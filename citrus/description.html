        <p>
            Citrus work like lego blocks. Roughly speaking, any two citrus
            can hybridize and produce potentially new citrus varieties.
            In fact, all citrus that you see in the produce section of the
            market are hybrids. A grapefruit is actually a cross of a pummelo
            with a sweet orange. An a sweet orange is a cross of a pummelo
            with a sweet mandarin. And a sweet mandarin is a cross of a
            pummelo with a pure mandarin. A pure mandarin crossed with a
            pummelo can also produce a sour orange. And a sour orange crossed
            with a citron yields a lemon. You get the picture. Citrus are
            as promiscuous as it gets.

            This large variety of hybridization possibilities corresponds to
            a variety of citrus fruit shapes. Can we quantify such shape
            diversity? If we can mathematically describe the shape of both
            a pummelo and a sweet orange, would I be able to predict that
            their shape combination yields a grapefruit?
        </p>
        <p>
            We are especially interested in being able to quantify and
            characterize the distribution of the <em>oil glands</em> on
            the citrus fruits. Citrus essential oils are important for the
            food and perfume industries. Oil glands also play a fundamental
            role in citrus fruit development. There are plenty of unknowns
            going forward.
        </p>
        <h3>The setup</h3>
        <p>
            In collaboration with the <a href="https://citrusvariety.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">Givaudan
            Citrus Variety Collection</a> at University of California&mdash;Riverside,
            we got access to 158 individual fruit samples comprising 64
            citrus varieties. These included all the fundamental citrus (citrons,
            pure mandarins, pummelos), close relatives (trifoliates,
            kumquats, microcitrus), and important hybrids (sweet oranges, lemons, etc.)
            These were X-ray CT scanned at Michigan State University. After
            a lot of image processing fiddling, we manage to segment out
            the central column, flesh, rind, skin, and oil glands for each
            citrus fruit.
        </p>

            We focus on the oil glands. We can represent each oil gland
            as point in space where the <em>x,y,z</em> coordinates are the
            center of mass of each gland. That is, each citrus fruit now
            can be thought as point cloud in space (!) As a sanity check,
            we verify that our count of individual oil glands goes in hand
            with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1546" target="_blank">established literature</a>.

        <h3>Modeling citrus fruits as ellipsoids</h3>
        <p>
            It seemed natural to model citrus as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid" target="_blank">ellipsoids</a>
            &mdash;an affine
            transformation of a sphere. This was done by simply performing
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares" target="_blank">ordinary
            least squares regression</a> to find the best algebraic parameters
            of the general ellipsoid formula. Next, the point cloud made of
            all oil gland centers was projected to the best-fit ellipsoid.
            Finally, we reparameterized these centers in terms of geodetical
            coordinates &mdash;latitude and longitude. But latitude and
            longitude coordinates can be thought as lying on a unit sphere, as
            well.
            We thus have a size-independent common
            framework to compare all the oil glands for all the citrus fruit
            varieties.
            We visualized the oil glands on 2D via two
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection">Lambert
            cylindrical equal-area projections</a> from the north and south poles.

        <h3>Directional statistics</h3>
        <p>
            Now that all our oil gland data can be represented as points on
            a common unit sphere, we turn to
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11749-021-00759-x" target="_blank">directional
            statistics</a>. Directional statistics allows us to characterize
            distributions specifically on circles, spheres, and related surfaces.
            We can also test whether a collection of points on a sphere
            follow a known distribution. To this end, we observed that there is
            no statistical evidence that supports the hypothesis of glands being
            uniformly distributed. Nor there was evidence in favor of rotational
            symmetry.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>What is the distribution then?</h3>
        <p>
            We can compute an empiric distribution via
            <a href="https://idyll-lang.github.io/fidyll-examples/fast-kde/scroller/" target="_blank">kernel
            density estimation (KDE)</a>. As expected, there is a spherical-specific
            KDE that we can use. As in the linear case, our KDE will depend
            on a bandwidth parameter that will determine how smooth our
            empiric distribution is. We can play around with varying bandwidth
            parameters and observe which regions show the most dramatic
            distribution changes.

        <h3>Future directions</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we are convinced that our pipeline enables us to quantify
            and compare citrus fruit shape, the potential
            future directions are exciting. To name a few:

        <h3>Ellipsoid approximations</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Given a pointcloud, a set of 3D x,y,z coordinates, what are the parameters
            of the best-fit ellipsoid</em>? I was surprised there was not a
            straightforward, widely-accepted answer. I also realized how
            rusty my pre-calculus math is by now. There are a number of papers
            out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/GMAP.2004.1290055">Li and
            Griffiths (2004)</a> as it was both mathematically and computationally
            the most straightforward answer I could find. They simply perform an
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares" target="_blank">OLS</a>
            to find the algebraic parameters that minimize the algebraic residuals
            for the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric">general quadric surface</a></em>.
            In principle, this approach could produce parameters that approximate
            the points with a paraboloid or hyperboloid instead. You must know
            that your point cloud indeed looks like an ellipsoid. Supposedly they
            use Lagrange multipliers to guarantee that you'll always get
            ellipsoid paramters, but I personally did not verify it.
        </p>

        <p>
            This approach will give you algebraic parameters of the general quadric surface
            equation. To translate these into more intuitive geometric parameters
            (semiaxes lengths, origin, rotation, etc.), you can follow Section 2.4 of

                is a relative easy read for someone with a basic math
                background. They propose a two-step approximation to obtain the ellipsoid.
                The first step is an algebraic parameter approximation like
                in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/GMAP.2004.1290055">Li and
                Griffiths (2004)</a>. The second is a geometric parameter
                approximation. However, I was unable to get significant results
                from this second step. Maybe it only works with geoids, with
                very large ellipsoids the size of a planet, not for ellipsoids
                the size of a lemon.</li>

            Once we have the ellipsoid parameters, we have to
            project our original point cloud onto such ellipsoid.
            This projection can be either:
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geocentric</strong>: By drawing a ray from the
                ellipsoid center to the point and noting where the ray
                intersects the ellipsoid surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Geodetic</strong>: By projecting the point
                perpendicularly to the ellipsoid surface, i.e., by minimizing
                the distance from the point to the surface.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            The former projection can be computed immediately. The latter
            requires a much more ellaborate computation.
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2020.104551">Diaz-Toca <em>et al.</em> (2020)</a>
            Is a very well-written breakdown of the computations needed, and
            they even provide a link to C code that works out of the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of the projection used, we can then reparameterize
            the original point cloud in (latitude, longitude, height) coordinates.
            We can then translate the (latitude, longitude) coordinates to
            a unit sphere. These unit sphere will be the common ground that
            will allow us to compare all citrus at once.

        <h3>Directional statistics</h3>
        <p>
            Directional statistics is a relatively new branch of statistics which
            focuses on statistics where the domain is not a Euclidean space
            &mdash;as with regular statististics&mdash; but
            a circle, sphere, torical or cylindrical.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1999 seminal textbook <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470316979"><em>Directional Statistics</em></a>
            by Mardia and Jupp is pretty good. It is seminal for a reason.
            It basically compiles everything
            that was known on the subject until that point. The textbook is quite
            comprehensive, the index is very fleshed out, and most of the
            chapters are self-contained. You can jump straight into the
            the relevant content for the application you have in mind.
            It also comes with plenty of citations so you can dive deeper
            into the relevant literature.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than 20 years later, Mardia and Jupp are still relevant.
            Their textbook is still one of the best ways to get familiar with
            the foundational ideas.
            Naturally the discipline has grown, and there
            have been plenty of advances since 1999.
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315119472">Ley and Verdebout's
            <em>Modern Directional Statistics</em> (2017)</a> aims to be an update.
            They still provide some basic definitions and concepts, albeit
            very succintly and refer the reader back to Mardia and Jupp
            plenty of times.
            Ley and Verdebout are still a pretty good reference to know
            where to start the google scholar search on how to do a particular
            task in directional statistics.
            Applications are fleshed out in their complement
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315228570"><em>Applied
            Directional Statistics</em>.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A brief review, update, and historical overview of the discipline is
            provided by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11749-021-00759-x">Pewsey
            and García Portugués (2021)</a>. Their last section covers on
            some of the available software to do actual computations. Fortunately,
            most of the software comes as R packages, works out of the box,
            and it is easy to use.

        <h3>Citrus are intrinsically linked to human history</h3>
        <p>
            I love the <a href="https://gastropod.com/" target="_blank">Gastropod
            podcast</a>. The food that we consume is more than just food.
            It is also a reflection of human culture and history. Food shaped
            our society. Citrus are no exception. As <a href="http://www.cynthiagraber.com/home/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Cynthia Graber</a>
            and <a href="http://www.ediblegeography.com/" target="_blank">Nicola Twilley</a> say,
            &laquo;not only were these [citrus] fruits so precious that they inspired both museums and the Mafia, they are also under attack by an incurable immune disease that is decimating citrus harvests around the world.&raquo;
            <a href="https://gastropod.com/museums-mafia-secret-history-citrus/" target="_blank">Listen to their whole citrus episode!</a>

            Also, I highly recommend you following and watching
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WeirdExplorer" target="_blank">@WeirdExplorer</a>
            YouTube channel for a foodie insight into the wide, global
            fruit variety. He
            has a number of citrus-specific episodes. In particular, one of
            his first episodes roughly explains how most citrus are hybrids.
        </p>

        <p>
            And this one is pretty good as well. It also contains an important
            message that fruit naming matters. There is a reason why the
            <em>Makrut lime</em> should be always called <em>Makrut lime</em>
            and not something else.

            Citrus are quite fascinating. Their history is intrinsically
            linked to ours. To name a few fun facts.
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00205.x" target="_blank">Citrus paved the way to the first modern medical trials
                in Western medicine</a>. Scurvy was the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.1986.tb07575.x">biggest
                scourge of the seas</a>. It is estimated than more sailors died
                due to scurvy than the rest of diseases and sea battles combined.
                One day, the British tested the anecdotes of sailors being scurvy-resistant due
                to regular consumption of citrus. Several ships were sent for long
                voyages. One was provided with citrus juice. Others were provided with no
                fruits but fresh water, or various elixirs. This was the setup of
                the first modern medical trial.</li>
                <li>Very specific citrus are a key for various South and
                South East Asian cuisines.
                There are
                anecdotes of Thai immigrants <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/01636545-2010-027">trespassing the Citrus Variety
                Collection of UC Riverside to obtain key ingredients</a> back in the 60s.
                Else, people would smuggle citrus from
                Asia to California to complete important dishes.
                Smuggling naturally comes with a high risk of importing
                diseases, which can be particularly catastrophic for comercial
                fields of citrus as most of the commercially grown citrus fruits
                are essentially clones. <a href="https://swfrec.ifas.ufl.edu/hlb/database/pdf/21_Karp_12.pdf">It
                is important to develop citrus varieties that can grow in
                other climates to both supply people with fruits and eliminate
                the need of dangerous smuggling</a>.</li>
                <li>Qu Yuan, probably the most important classic Chinese
                poet, depicted an orange tree as a symbol of steadfastness and
                resilience in the beautiful poem <a href="https://doi.org/10.6420/DHJHS.199907.0069" target="_blank"><em>Ju song</em></a>.
                Although we <a href="https://archive.org/details/songsofsouthanci0000unse">do not know for certain if
                Qu Yuan is the actual author of the poem</a>, it is beautiful nonetheless.
                For context, Qu Yuan was a renowned advisor of a king circa 200 BC.
                Inner conflicts with other advisors and court members led to
                rumor spreads and backstabbing, which forced Qu Yuan to be
                exiled from the kingdom. According to the legend, Qu Yuan was
                absolutely distraught, he was profoundly hurt that his king
                believed others' words and not his. Qu Yuan was roaming when
                he observed an orange tree. He was captivated, given the fact
                that orange trees were not supposed to grow, let alone flourish,
                in that region, where the climate was colder. If an orange
                tree was able to grow against harsh climates, he as a poet
                should be able to withstand the terrible setbacks.</li>
                <li>Citrons, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrog">etrogs</a> are key in some Jewish festivities. The relationship between etrogs and the Jewish community <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.129.3343.179" target="_blank">goes back millenia</a>. In fact, modern evidence suggests that as the Jewish community moved westward towards modern Europe, <a href="https://doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI11023-16">they brought citrus cultivation and citrus breeding with them</a>. It was thanks to their migration that Romans tasted citrus for the first time, and they made quite an impact, especially across Italy and Spain.</li>
