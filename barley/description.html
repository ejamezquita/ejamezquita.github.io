        <h2>Quantifying the shape of barley grains</h2>
        <p>
            Barley is more than just beer. It is the fourth most cultivated grain around the world,
            behind maize, rice, and wheat. Barley is probably the most
            adaptable crop out there. There are barley land races that are
            originary from the warm, low-altituted, humid climate of the
            <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-09/the-last-crop-before-the-desert/" target="_blank">Moroccan Meditarrenean coast</a>; others adapted to the dry,
            cold, high-altitude terrain of the <a href="https://www.tibettravel.org/tibetan-culture/highland-barley.html" target="_blank">Tibetan plateau</a>.
            And then there
            are barley land races for every other climate in-between, across
            the whole Eurasian continent, from the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/travel/2020/05/photo-story-from-barley-fields-to-whisky-barrels-in-rural-scotland" target="_blank">Scottish Orkney Islands</a>,
            to <a href="https://kizilvest.ru/20150827-v-kizilskom-rajone-nachalas-uborochnaya-strada/" target="_blank">Urals in Russia</a>; from the <a href="https://cereal.interreg-npa.eu/subsites/CEREAL/Barley_cultivation-Norway_Presentation_2018.pdf" target="_blank">Norweigian Artic circle</a> to
            the <a href="https://thewire.in/agriculture/covid-19-lockdown-crop-harvest-farmers" target="_blank">Rajasthan praires in India</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even looking at the seeds, we can already see that some land races
            have small, rounded seeds; while others have long, elongated shapes.
            It is natural then to ask <em>How does shape correspond to this
            climate versatility?</em> And in turn <em>How do we comprehensively
            capture shape nuances across barley grains?</em>
            For shape quantification, as you might guess, we drew tools from
            <a href="../tda/description.html" target="_blank">Topological Data Analysis</a>.
            Especifically, we used the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/imaiai/iau011"  target="_blank">Euler Characteristic Transform</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT)</h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic" target="_blank">Euler Characteristic</a>
            (EC) of an object is a topological invariant. That is,
            it is a quantity that remains unchanged if we stretch, shrink, twist, or
            <em>smoothly</em> deform the object. However, it might change if we cut, paste, or
            pierce the object.
            The EC is attractive to our purposes, as it is both easy to compute
            and intrisically connected to the topological features of an
            object. From the Euler-Poincaré formula, we know that:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-family:Lucida Console,Courier New,monospace;">
            EC = #(connected components) - #(loops) + #(voids)
            <br>
            EC = #(vertices) - #(edges) + #(faces).
        </p>
        <p>
            Following this formula, we see why all Platonic Solids share
            the same EC of 2. Which in turn is the same EC of a sphere.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 0.8em; color: Grey;">

            <br>
            Credits: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The EC on its own is too simple, though. We cannot tell apart
            a pyramid from a cube based solely on their ECs. We thus turn to
            the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) of objects. The ECT
            of barley seeds in our case. First, we fix a direction,
            say top to bottom. Then, we slice our seed across that direction
            and we compute how the EC changes as we "add slices". This gives
            us a topological signature, a time series on how the topology
            changes as we traverse the seed vertically.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 10px; color: Grey;">
            <img src="figs/ecc_ver2.gif" alt="Euler Characteristic Curve"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>How do we choose the right direction?</em> We do not. We
            simply take <em>all</em> possible directions. For every direction, we
            slice and dice our seeds across such direction. That gives us
            different topological signatures, that we concatenate in a
            single, very long vector. This whole procedure is refered to as
            the ECT of the seed. For illustrative purposes, the animation
            below shows the same seed being sliced across three different
            directions and we record its ECT below.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 10px; color: Grey;">
            <img src="figs/ect_ver2.gif" alt="Euler Characteristic Curve"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The ECT is mathematically quite interesting.</em> In 2014,
            <a href="https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/academics/katharine-turner" target="_blank">Turner</a>,
            <a href="https://sayanmuk.github.io/" target="_blank">Mukherjee</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.dougmboyer.com/" target="_blank">Boyer</a>
            <em>mathematically</em>
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/imaiai/iau011"  target="_blank">
                proved that the ECT is injective and that it effectively
                summarizes <em>all</em> the morphological information
                of an object</a>.
            In other words, two different shapes will produce two different ECTs;
            and if we are given two different ECTs, these must come from
            two different shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important caveat is that for the mathematical theorem to hold,
            we need to slice our seeds across <em>all</em> possible directions.
            We cannot perform infinite computations, though. As a proof of
            concept, we simply took a large number of directions and ran with it.
            About 150 directions seemed to be enough for our purposes.
            We observed that taking 200, 300, and 400 directions did not
            improve our results.
        </p>
        <h3>The barley data</h3>
        <p>
            In collaboration with the University of California&mdash;Riverside,
            we got access to barley panicle samples corresponding to 28 different
            land races from 28 very different climates. These panicles were later
            X-ray CT scanned at Michigan State University. But we want the grains.
            After plenty of trial and error with image processing, a script
            was developed to automatically extract <em>digitally</em> individual
            grains from all the panicles.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            Once we have individual 3D grains, we measure barley grain
            shape with two different sets of shape descriptors:
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional</strong>: length, width, volume, surface area, etc. for each grain.
                We used 11 traditional descriptors in total.</li>
                <li><strong>Topological</strong>: the ECT computed across 158 directions across 16 slices per direction
                This produced a very large vector of more than 2500 dimensions per seed (!).
                To avoid shenanigans from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>,
                this large vector was later aggresively reduced to just 12 dimensions using
                <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">UMAP</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Barley Classification Results</h3>
        <p>
            <em>How descriptive is our shape quantification?</em> As a
            sanity check, we first test whether shape information alone
            is enough to tell apart seeds from different accessions.
            Now that we describe numerically the shape of every seed, we
            can employ many machine learning classification algorithms.
            We chose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank">
            support vector machine (SVM)</a> due to its simplicity and
            the fact that we do not require large amounts of training data
            (unlike neural networks).
            Following a supervised learning pipeline, we chose 75% of the
            seeds from each accession as training data. With this training,
            the machine tries to deduce a pattern that characterizes the
            numerical descriptors corresponding to each accession. Next,
            we verify how good of job the machine did for pattern recognition.
            We test such pattern recognition asking the machine to
            predict the accession of the 25% of grains remaining based
            solely on numerical shape description. Finally, we compute the
            machine accuracy.
            Below is an illustration of supervised learning with
            3 accessions. In our experiment, we worked with 28 accessions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size: 10px; color: Grey;">
            <img src="../demat/figs/supervised_learning.png" alt="Supervised Learning"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            We trained 3 different SVMs. One used only traditional shape
            descriptors. The other used solely topological shape descriptors.
            And the last one used both sets of descriptors. The classification
            accuracy results were quite encouraging.

        <p>
            <br>
            Just using traditional descriptors, the machine does a decent
            job already. It correctly predicts the accession 55% of the time.
            For comparison, if the machine were to guess randomly out of
            28 possible accessions, it would give the correct answer less
            than 4% of the time.
            If we use topological shape descriptors, the machine accuracy
            <em>improves</em>, which suggests that the ECT is capturing
            shape nuances that are not readily seen by the naked eye.
            Finally, combining both sources of morphological information
            yields the <em>best</em> results.
        </p>
        <p>
            A closer examination of the results shows that traditional shape
            descriptors highlight shape similarities across barley
            accessions. Topological shape descriptors highlight similarites
            across <em>individual panicles</em>. Thus, their combination
            yields exciting results at both population and individual levels (!)
            Compare Figures 5 and 6 from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab033" target="_blank">our
            paper</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>But what does topology really measure?</h3>
        <p>
            One key advantage of the ECT over other TDA methods is that it
            is relatively easy to observe how physical, shape features are
            topologically encoded. In the ECT case, we can use a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance" target="_blank">Kruskal-Wallis
            One Way Analysis of Variance</a> to determine which directions
            and slices were topologically different across seeds corresponding
            to different barley varieties. Turns out that the most significant
            shape differences across accessions correspond to the top
            and bottom sides of the seeds!

        </p>
        <h3>Future directions</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we are convinced that our shape descriptors do a good
            job of telling apart different barley accessions, the potential
            future directions are exciting. To name a few:

            My PhD advisor, <a href="https://www.elizabethmunch.com/" target="_blank">Liz Munch</a>,
            does a pretty good job at explaining
            the ECT and this barley project. Her seminar was prepared to
            include a non-topology audience.

            The ECT was originally proposed as the cheap cousin of the
            Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) in the same <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/imaiai/iau011"  target="_blank">Turner
            <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a> paper. In fact, Turner <em>et al</em>
            first prove that the PHT is injective. Since the proof relies
            on keeping track of EC changes, the proof of injectivity extends
            immediately to the ECT. Personally, I found reading Turner
            <em>et al</em> quite challenging at first.
            <a href="barley/slides/lab200330.pdf" target="_blank">Here are some slides</a>
            I made with plenty of figures to ease the reading.
        </p>
        <h3>ECT in the math literature</h3>
        <p>
            As I mentioned above, the ECT is a very interesting mathematical
            technique. There are plenty of mathematical advances that have
            been developed recently.
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1090/btran/122" target="_blank">Curry,
                Mukherjee, and Turner (2022)</a> extend the original 2014 paper.
                They show that the injectivity of the PHT and ECT extends
                to all dimensions. Moreover, they prove the existence of finite
                bounds when it comes to choose directions. Good news: we do not
                need infinite directions to mathematically guarantee the
                injectivity of the ECT (yay). Bad news: the bound is still
                absurdly large, and right now only works for theoretical
                purposes.</li>
                <li><em>If we are handed a topological signature, a string of numbers that we
                are told come from an ECT, can we <strong>reconstruct</strong>
                the original shape this ECT signature comes from?</em>
                <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/peterbubenik/files/Betthauser_Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">The
                dissertation of Leo Betthauser</a> provides some insight
                into how we can reconstruct 2D images based solely on their
                ECT signatures.</li>
                <li>Things get way trickier in 3D. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12759" target="_blank">Fasy
                <em>et al</em> (2022)</a> provide some exciting initial insights for
                small test cases. A computationally-feasible algorithm for
                real-life data remamins elusive.</li>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2019.1671198" target="_blank">Crawford
                <em>et al</em> (2020)</a> propose an alternative: the
                Smooth Euler Characteristic Transform (SECT). This is obtained
                by first computing the ECT as explained before, and then
                this piecewise linear signal is integrated. This seemingly
                simple extra step guarantees that the SECT is now a
                continuous function that lives in the L2 space, the space
                of all real-valued continuous functions. This in
                turn opens the door to plenty of tools from the functional
                analysis realm.</li>
                <li><em>Maybe not all slices and directions should count
                the same.</em> If we have additional information of the
                data we are trying to characterize morphologically, then we
                can tune the ECT to give more weight to certain directions.
                This Weighted ECT is explored by <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w50/Jiang_The_Weighted_Euler_Curve_Transform_for_Shape_and_Image_Analysis_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf" target="_blank">Jiang, Kurtek and Needham (2020)</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1214/20-AOAS1430" target="_blank">Wang
                <em>et al.</em> (2021)</a> combine the ECT with SINATRA,
                a statistical pipeline that takes in two classes of shapes
                and highlights the physical features that best describe
                the variation between them.</li>

        <h3>Barley is more than just beer</h3>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Barley is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.4060/cb1993en" target="_blank">fourth
                most cultivated crop</a>, behind rice, maize, and wheat.</li>
                <li>There are barley land races that have
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0465-2_2168" target="_blank">adapted
                to virtually every climated</a> across the whole
                Eurasian continent.</li>
                <li>In fact, this wonderful adaptability paved the way to
                the first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259172" target="_blank">permanent
                human settlements in the Tibetan plateau</a>. Barley provided
                a reliable food source to the first inhabitants of the region.</li>
                <li>In general, this historical and natural adaptability of
                barley provides important insights into paleobotany. For instance,
                charred and fossilized barley grains give important clues on
                how the prehistoric human populations moved across

                France</a>.</li>
                <li>The versatility of barley makes it a crucial crop to
