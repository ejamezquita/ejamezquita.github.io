<h1>Sleep and the Daily Struggle for Sync</h1>
<p>For many years, this circadian pacemaker was nothing more than a hypothetical entity. Its existence was inferred indirectly, just as atoms were in the nineteenth century. The search for its location in the body always had the potential to degenerate into an endless chase based on a wrongheaded question. After all, early experiments on single/celled algae had shown that even they could exhibit circadian rhythms. So for more complex, multicellular creatures like ourselves, it might be that the whole organism is made of trillions of clocks. In other words, we might not have a clock; we might <em>be</em> a clock.</p>
<p>And the spooky thought is turning out to be right. For 30 years we’ve known that adrenal glands and liver cells can display circadian rhythms of their own, even when they are removed from the body and kept alive in a dish. The same now appears to be true of heart cells and kidney cells. Clock genes are turning up everywhere in the bodies of fruit flies and small mammals like mice and hamsters; presumably we, too, are congregations of circadian oscillators.</p>
<p>Still, there has always been strong reason to believe that, in mammals at least, all these peripheral clocks are ruled by a single master, probably localized somewhere in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Early work in the field is reviewed in Moore-Ede et al., “The clocks that time us,” (1982), pp. 134-139. For more recent developments in this rapidly moving branch of circadian biology, see Yamazaki et al. (2000); Storch et al (2002); P. McNamara et al., “Regulation of CLOCK and MOP4 by nuclear hormone receptors in the vasculature: A humoral mechanism to reset a peripheral clock,” <em>Cell</em> 105 (2001), pp. 877-889; C. Schubert, “Vitamin A calibrates a heart clock, 27-7,” <em>Science News</em> 160 (July 14, 2001), p. 22; and Michael H. Hastings, “A gut feeling for time,” <em>Nature</em> 417 (2002), pp. 391-392.</span> As far back as the early 1900s, doctors had noticed that patients with tumors in the area suffered from irregular sleep-wake cycles. An even more telling piece of evidence came from the work of Curt Richter, a biologist at Johns Hopkins University, who spent almost 60 years stalking the circadian pacemaker. In an arduous and gruesome series of experiments, Richter blinded rats and then systematically removed their adrenals, pituitaries, thyroids, or gonads; induced convulsions; and administered electroshock, alcoholic stupor, and prolonged anesthesia. After sewing the rats back up and returning them to their cages, he found that none of these horrific interventions altered their free-running activity rhythms.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> For a review of Richter’s work, and the later work that localized the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, see Moore-Ede et al. (1982), pp. 152-157.</span> The clock was still ticking. Then he cut their brains in one location after another, testing whether any individual lesion disrupted their circadian rhythms. None of the nicks made any difference. The rats went right on feeding, drinking, and running rhythmically—except when the lesions were placed in the front part of the hypothalamus. Then the rats became arrhythmic.</p>
