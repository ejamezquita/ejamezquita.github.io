<h2>Chapter 2: Crippled</h2>
<p>I wasn’t drawn to math research anymore. My experience in graduate school at MIT had been brutal, and I hadn’t recovered from it. I also found that I was more drawn to the real world now than I had been in my early twenties. I wanted to become more fully baked, acquiring a browned crust where academia had left me white and squishy. My thoughts turned toward writing: Beginning in childhood, I’d been conceiving of books I’d like to write. I settled on writing about science, since that seemed to weave together many of my interests and talents. To get started, I decided to do a yearlong graduate program in science writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The Split Between the Worlds</h2>
<p>It was a hard thing for me to absorb: Doctors weren’t going to help.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that there was no magic pill to fix me. Plenty of other illnesses couldn’t be fixed with magic pills—but at least they had legitimate specialists who would try to help. Chronic fatigue syndrome, it seemed, didn’t count as a “real” illness. The problem was less that people explicitly asserted that CFS was psychosomatic—my friends never said that, and only that one doctor I saw had discussed the possibility—and more that it lacked all the trappings of legitimacy, with proper doctors and blood tests and researchers and conferences and solid information on Web sites. If you told people you had cancer or multiple sclerosis or lupus, you got lots of sympathy. If you said you had chronic fatigue syndrome, you often heard, “Oh yeah, I’m tired all the time too.”</p>
<p>I tried to avoid the name, saying something vague, like “Well, doctors haven’t really figured out what’s going on with me. Seems to be some strange neurological something.” I might add, “Some have called it chronic fatigue syndrome, but that doesn’t really mean anything.” After all, it wasn’t at all clear that whatever was broken in my body was also broken in the bodies of other CFS sufferers. The only thing calling my illness “chronic fatigue syndrome” seemed to add was a stain of stigma, as if the name provided a window into my soul and displayed some moral failing within me.</p>
<p>I read online patient boards, hoping to learn something useful from my fellow patients, but I was put off by all the ridiculous treatments people discussed seriously: A woman wore magnets in her underwear to balance her hormones; a man was shining a red light up his nose; someone even contemplated drinking cow urine. Even worse was the endless, frightening misery. <em>These people aren’t like me. This won’t be my future</em>.</p>
<p>But the truth was, I couldn’t find any compelling patterns that predicted when I was strong and when I was bedbound. I felt as though my illness might as well have been controlled by the Greek gods, creatures more irrational and capricious than the human mind can comprehend.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I tried to explain that running off after every quack treatment my friends pushed on me just made me feel desperate and hopeless. The reality was that nobody knew what to do about this fucking disease—if they did, I would have heard about it by then. I figured that my life would be richest—and I’d also be more likely to get better—if I accepted that reality and dealt with it, rather than running from it and imagining that the next random treatment some friend recommended was going to magically cure me.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>When I reached the pool, I collapsed into the water. The weightlessness in the water felt reassuringly good, though as I looked at the impossibly faraway end of the pool, I thought, <em>This might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever tried</em>. I reminded myself that I didn’t have to swim that whole distance. I put my goggles on, pushed feebly off the wall, and pulled my arms in a slow breaststroke.</p>
<p>After just a few strokes, a wave passed over me, as if a current traveled from my brain down through my body and filled me with the power I’d been missing. <em>Holy shit!</em> My kicks began propelling me forward, and my arms moved fluidly. I reveled in the delight of being able to move freely, forcing myself to stop after five laps to make sure I didn’t overdo it.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>We started by discussing the most basic emotional fact of my childhood: I grew up believing that I had been brought into this world to save my mother.</p>
<p>As a child, I could have articulated neither that duty nor what threatened her, but my responsibility was as apparent to me as my dirty blond hair or skinny, coltish legs. Something wasn’t right with the person I was most devoted to in all the world. Throughout my childhood, my mother didn’t have friends, or a job, or a husband. She’d been alone since she’d left her husband six months after I was born, taking me and my two siblings with her; my father, with whom she’d had an affair during her marriage, had chosen to stay with his wife and five other children. My mother relied, somewhat precariously, on family money to pay her bills. She spent hours every day sitting on her bed playing solitaire. She sometimes careened into towering, inexplicable rages. When I was seven, she sent my older brother and sister away to live elsewhere, leaving just me and her in the house together.</p>
<p>As far as I could see, I was the person to fix whatever undefinable thing seemed to be ailing her. Certainly, no one else seemed to be volunteering for the job. How to accomplish this wasn’t so obvious, though.</p>
<p>So I had to figure it out on my own, just as I would many years later with chronic fatigue syndrome. The two experiences had very much the same quality for me, lying outside language, outside acceptability, outside any structure in which I could expect to receive help or even understanding. I spent time with Chris talking about the strategies I had used as a kid for dealing with my mother, because I recognized that I would naturally be inclined, for better or worse, to think about my illness in similar ways.</p>
<p>As a child, I had instinctively figured that the place to start on my overwhelming task was to deeply, sympathetically understand my mother’s view of the world. Though she’d formally left the Christian Science church after the scandal broke about my extramarital conception, her religious beliefs hadn’t shifted. For her, the physical world of chairs and stomachaches and paychecks was an illusion: True reality was purely spiritual. Thus the way to achieve what you want in the physical world was to work on this deeper, underlying, <em>real</em> plane, to refine yourself spiritually.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Great Collapse</h2>
<p>I was also struck by how different the experience felt to me than it would have if I’d had a clear, unambiguous, scientifically ratified explanation for what had happened. The upside was that the experience had an openness, a fertility about it—I felt more room to create my own meaning. It felt potentially, if not actually, profound. If I’d had, say, an especially bad bout of mononucleosis, I imagined that the simple, mechanistic explanation would have felt so complete and compelling that it would have left room for little else, and the experience might have felt banal.</p>
<hr />
<p>One morning as I was counting down the days until my appointment, I was reading the <em>New York Times</em> on my phone—sitting up to use my computer was far too hard—and came upon the headline “Psychotherapy Eases Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Study Finds.”<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> David Tuller, “Psychotherapy Eases Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Study Finds,” New York Times, February 17, 2011, <a href="www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/health/research/18fatigue.html">URL</a>.</span></p>
<p><em>Psychotherapy? Are they saying this is a mental problem?</em></p>
<p>Reading further, I learned that the study claimed that both psychotherapy and a gradual increase in exercise could make CFS patients feel significantly better. The article continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While this may sound like good news, the findings—published Thursday in the Lancet—are certain to displease many patients and to intensify a fierce, long-running debate about what causes the illness and how to treat it…</p>
<p>The new study … is expected to lend ammunition to those who think the disease is primarily psychological or related to stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt the heat rise to my face. <em>Oh my god, what will my editors think?</em> I’d been juggling deadlines, trying to tell my editors enough so they’d cut me some slack but not so much to alarm them. I imagined them reading the article and figuring: <em>Ah! Julie’s not getting me that story because she’s fucked in the head! Too lazy to get out of bed and exercise. Science has proven it</em>.</p>
<p>As for exercise, my very first strategy when I’d started getting sick was to swallow my pride, start with only slow, short runs, and gradually build up. It hadn’t worked, though I’d tried it again and again. <em>If this study is right, shouldn’t I be cured by now?</em></p>
<p>At the same time… jeez, the <em>Lancet</em>. That was about as good a medical journal as there was. Plus the study, nicknamed the PACE trial<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> P. D. White, et al., “Comparison of adaptive pacing therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, graded exercise therapy, and specialist medical care for chronic fatigue syndrome (PACE): A randomised trial,” Lancet 377, no. 9768 (March 2011): 823–36.</span>, was enormous by the standards of chronic fatigue syndrome: 641 subjects, $8 million.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> It was 5 million British pounds, which converts to $8 million in 2011 dollars. See <a href="https://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/ra5a.aspx?id=176&amp;type=hei&amp;subid=3181">Section 2.1.4</a>. “The PACE trial (7 UK centres) of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) treatments (MRC; £5.0M).”</span> <em>Could there somehow be something to this?</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t just in the United Kingdom that researchers were pursuing psychological explanations for the disease: I’d been ignoring a steady stream of similar but less well-publicized research in the United States. Just a few months before, for example, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claimed that 29 percent of CFS patients had a personality disorder, compared with just seven percent of the general population. It was important for doctors to understand this, the paper concluded, because “this might be associated with being noncompliant with treatment suggestions, displaying unhealthy behavioral strategies and lacking a stable social environment.”<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> U.M.

<p>When I read about that study, I thought, <em>Fuck you! Let’s give you a horrendous illness, deny you decent medical care and disability payments, have your friends and family tell you you’re crazy, and then see how your mental health fares!</em> Comparing CFS patients with healthy folks was absurd—they should have been comparing them with other chronically ill patients. And indeed, a 2003 study in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research compared CFS patients with those with multiple sclerosis and found equal rates of neuroticism and depression (which isn’t the same as a personality disorder, but still…).</p>

<div id="chapter-6-the-miracle" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 6: The Miracle</h2>
<p>Her quick-and-dirty explanation for the illness was that it boiled down to neuroinflammation. That was what was screwing up my legs, she said. The international name for chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalo myelitis, fit with this explanation: “Myalgic” means pain, “encephalo-” means the brain, “-myel-” means the spinal cord, and “-itis” means inflammation. Because the name chronic fatigue syndrome is so misleading, Klimas and others often called the disease ME/CFS, as a way of sneaking the less familiar international name into the American consciousness.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> At the time of writing this book, there is no good name for this illness. “Chronic fatigue syndrome” is horrendous—trivializing, inaccurate, and overly broad—but “myalgic encephalomyelitis” has its own drawbacks. <br><br> I know of no scientists who use the term “myalgic encephalomyelitis” on its own. They point out that we have only a small amount of scientific evidence to support the idea that patients’ brains and spinal cords are inflamed (though it sure felt like it to me!). We don’t know at this point if all patients have neuroinflammation, and we certainly don’t know if neuroinflammation is at the root of the diverse array of symptoms that plague patients. <br><br> From a patient perspective, however, “myalgic encephalomyelitis” has a lot going for it. Those who are seriously affected pretty much all have both pain and neurological symptoms that seem related to inflammation. The scientific evidence for neuroinflammation has grown over the last few years—and of course, with so little research funding, it’s hardly surprising that more evidence doesn’t yet exist. The name has a deeper pedigree than “chronic fatigue syndrome”: It was coined in 1956, and the World Health Organization continues to list it. And, of course, “myalgic encephalomyelitis” has a serious tone that is appropriate for the seriousness of the condition. The patient community has increasingly embraced the name ME. Many consider ME to be distinct from CFS, reserving the term ME for more severe forms of the illness. <br><br> The National Academy of Medicine suggested the name “systemic exertion intolerance disease” in its 2015 report on the illness, but that name has received little support. <br><br> For myself, I found the scientific objections to the name ME too compelling to ignore. I’ve stuck with ME/CFS as a compromise solution, especially because federal agencies are using that term and it’s one my journalism editors would accept. There’s no question that it’s a klunky compromise. It’s especially problematic for those working to distinguish ME from CFS. <br><br> The name issue is intimately connected to the issue of definition. Just what illness are we naming here? Both ME and CFS have multiple competing definitions, each of which captures a different patient population. Most likely, none of the definitions carves nature at its joints, capturing a precise set of patients who share a common root physiological problem. Very broad definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome, such as the Oxford definition which requires only six months of disabling fatigue as the primary symptom, certainly don’t. <br><br> I don’t think we’ll find a name or a definition that the community as a whole will embrace until high-quality science reveals the underlying mechanisms of the disease.</span></p>

<div id="part-2-solitary" class="section level1">
<h1>Part 2: Solitary</h1>
<div id="chapter-8-rage" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 8: Rage</h2>
<p>The first problem the forum geeks pointed out was pretty amazing: It wasn’t clear that the patients in the trial even had chronic fatigue syndrome! Participants were only required to have six months of disabling fatigue as a primary symptom—the very definition Klimas had criticized as overly broad. None of the other symptoms ordinarily required for an ME/CFS diagnosis, including brain fog, pain, blood pressure regulation problems, or sleep problems, were necessary—not even problems after exercise, which most experts considered the hallmark of the illness. And while patients with many fatiguing illnesses were excluded, it was okay to have major depression, even though that alone could explain the fatigue, and depression was well known to respond to exercise and CBT.</p>
<p>But that was just the beginning of the problems. The forum geeks pointed out that suspiciously, the only sign that CBT and exercise had helped patients was that the patients said they felt a bit better. Objectively, though, they hadn’t improved at all: They hadn’t gotten back to work, hadn’t gotten off welfare, hadn’t gotten more fit. Even the patients who exercised for a year did no better on a fitness test, and while they were able to walk slightly faster than at the beginning, they would still have lost a race with a patient in heart failure, severe multiple sclerosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.</p>
<p>Even more suspiciously, the researchers then pooh-poohed their own objective measures as flawed or irrelevant. It was the subjective self-assessments, they said, that really meant something. After all, they pointed out, how else can you tell how tired people are, other than asking them? <em>Okay, I thought, but shouldn’t the researchers acknowledge that the lack of objective improvement is disappointing, to say the least?</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, when I looked at how much better participants said they felt, it struck me as fairly pathetic. Patients started out feeling pretty terrible: They rated their own physical function at less than 40 on a 100-point scale that any moderately healthy person would ace. At the end of the trial, CBT and exercise improved their scores by fewer than 10 points. So a typical patient reported that he still couldn’t vacuum his house, climb more than one flight of stairs, or walk more than a few blocks—but he struggled a little less carrying in his groceries and, maybe, could just manage a single flight of stairs when he’d had to rest in the middle before. If I’d put a full year of effort into therapy, I think I would have felt pretty disappointed.</p>
<p>And even these slight improvements were suspect. I imagined myself as a participant in the trial: I come in and I’m asked to rate my symptoms. Then, for a year, I’m told that to get better, I have to pay less attention to my symptoms. Then I’m asked to rate my symptoms again. Won’t I feel a lot of pressure to say I feel a bit better, in order to do as I’m told, please my therapist, and convince myself I haven’t wasted a year of effort?</p>
<p>The irony, the geeks on the forum pointed out, was that the researchers’ modest results in fact offered compelling evidence against the theory that it was psychological problems and deconditioning that kept ME/CFS patients sick. After all, the researchers had given patients the best treatments they could to address those problems, and it had barely helped. CBT and exercise did no more for ME/CFS than for illnesses like lupus, multiple sclerosis, and fatigue from cancer treatment, all of which are known to be primarily biological in origin.</p>
<p>But one of the PACE researchers in a press conference described patients getting “back to normal.” Many news reports said that about 30 percent of participants had recovered and that 60 percent had improved. <em>Recovered! Normal! Sixty percent improved! How could that be, when the results are so puny?</em></p>
<p>My new friends the forum geeks had the answer for me: The researchers had changed their definitions of “recovery” and “improvement” after the trial began—weakening them so dramatically that patients deemed “recovered” at the end of the trial could be both more fatigued and less functional than when they began treatment.</p>
<p><em>They could get worse and be called recovered?</em></p>
<p>Originally, patients had to assess their own physical function at 85 or higher, among other requirements, to qualify as “recovered.” That was perhaps slightly low, given that fully healthy people would ace the test with 100—but hey, I would have been thrilled to score an 85, so it was plausible enough.</p>
<p>After the trial began, though, the researchers lowered the threshold for recovery to 60—which, shockingly, was worse than that of 92 percent of the working population and typical of an 80-year-old. But not only that, it was worse than the threshold of 65 for entry into the trial—which the researchers characterized as “significant disability.”</p>
<p>Similarly, patients could say they were more fatigued than when they entered the trial and still qualify as “recovered.”<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> A few technical details: The extensive press coverage about recovery came from two places. At the press conference when the Lancet study was first announced, one of the PACE researchers claimed that twice as many patients had gotten “back to normal” with CBT or exercise than without. In addition, a commentary accompanying the <em>Lancet</em> paper said that 30 percent met “a strict criterion for recovery.” <br><br> The <em>Lancet</em> paper itself, however, didn’t discuss recovery. Instead, it described the percentage of patients who were “within the normal range” on their fatigue and physical function scores. The “normal range,” however, is a statistical term that is unrelated to being “back to normal” or “recovered.” Nevertheless, that analysis was the basis for the claims in the press conference and commentary, and it provided the thresholds for fatigue and physical function scores I discuss. <br><br> Two years later, the researchers published their full analysis of recovery, in <em>Psychological Medicine</em>. <br><br> P. D. White, et al., “Recovery from chronic fatigue syndrome after treatments given in the PACE trial,” <em>Psychological Medicine</em> 43, no. 10 (October 2013): 2,227–35. <br><br> That paper’s claims were slightly more modest, reporting a 22 percent recovery rate for patients who received exercise or CBT, rather than 30 percent. <br><br> To be “recovered,” patients had to meet the same thresholds for fatigue and for physical function as in the “normal range” analysis in the Lancet. In addition, they had to meet two other criteria: Patients had to say they overall felt “much” or “very much” better, and they had to no longer qualify as having chronic fatigue syndrome. The latter sounds very impressive, but it excluded almost no participants who met the first three criteria. <br><br> All four of these criteria were much looser than the researchers had proposed before they started the trial.</span></p>
<p>At this point, I got downright furious. The PACE team’s changes in the definition of recovery—a definition colleagues of theirs touted as “strict” in an accompanying commentary<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> Gijs Bleijenberg and Hans Knoop, “Chronic fatigue syndrome: Where to PACE from here?” <em>Lancet</em> 377, no. 9768 (March 2011): 786–88. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60172-4.</span>—were absurd, and I couldn’t see how anyone could have failed to recognize that. <em>This isn’t just sloppy science. This borders on research misconduct.</em></p>
<p>The forum geeks pointed out that the researchers had strong motivation to claim a positive result: Some of them had worked as consultants for private disability insurance companies, earning money advising them that CBT and exercise would get patients back to work and that companies should deny payments to patients who hadn’t done these treatments<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> Michael Sharpe, “Functional Symptoms and Syndromes,” <em>Trends in Health and Disability 2002</em> (February 2012): 15–22.</span>—a fact they failed to disclose to participants in the trial. Plus, these researchers had invested their careers in this. They’d look terrible if the treatments failed.</p>
<p>Even though I had never had CBT or graded exercise pushed on me, I felt personally affected by the trial. <em>No wonder this disease is so alienating!</em> Wessely had first developed his theory nearly 25 years earlier<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> Anthony S. David, Simon Wessely, and Anthony J. Pelosi, “Postviral fatigue syndrome: time for a new approach,” <em>British Medical Journal</em> 296, no. 6623 (March 1988): 696–99.</span>, and his ideas had spread into US researchers’ and physicians’ ideas about the illness.<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> Mary Dimmock’s Thirty Years of Disdain chronicles this history thoroughly. It’s available for free <a href="http://bit.ly/30-years-of-disdain">here</a>.</span> These were the people who had helped turn chronic fatigue syndrome into a mark of shame.</p>
<p>I sometimes felt as though I were stewing helplessly in bile. I longed to expel my adrenaline-fueled fury with a rock-kicking, branch-breaking hike up a steep hill. Instead, I lifted a five-pound weight a few times, as much exercise as I could safely do. <em>Fucking ironic</em>, I thought as I set the weight down again, rage still pounding through my bloodstream.</p>
<p>I grew even more furious as I watched what happened to the forum geeks when they tried to bring these problems to light. They wrote blogs; they contacted the press; they successfully submitted carefully argued letters<label for="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">11</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">11</span> Andrew James Kewley, “The PACE trial in chronic fatigue syndrome,” <em>Lancet</em> 377, no. 9780 (May 2011): 1832.</span> and commentaries<label for="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">12</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">12</span> Alem Matthees, “Assessment of recovery status in chronic fatigue syndrome using normative data,” <em>Quality of Life Research</em> 24, no. 4 (April 2015): 905–7. doi: 10.1007/s11136-014-0819-0.</span> to the <em>Lancet</em> and elsewhere.

Why not include cancer patients too? Or stroke patients, or cardiac patients? Then you could apply your findings to even more people! The researchers certainly never offered any justification for their claim that patients could simultaneously be “significantly disabled” and “recovered.”</p>
<p>And the PACE researchers didn’t stop there. They and their defenders painted critics as unhinged crusaders who were impeding progress for the estimated 30 million ME/CFS patients around the world. The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, for example, went on the attack against the study’s critics, calling them “a fairly small, but highly organized, very vocal and very damaging group of individuals who have, I would say, actually hijacked this agenda and distorted the debate so that it actually harms the overwhelming majority of patients.”<label for="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">15</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">15</span> “Comparison of treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome—the PACE trial,” <em>Health Report</em>, April 18, 2011, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/healthreport/comparison-of-treatments-for-chronic-fatigue/2993296">URL</a>.</span></p>

<h2>Chapter 9: A Life, Limited</h2>
<p>The process of doing mathematics reworked my brain, teaching me a new way of thinking. I was entering a kind of priesthood, removed from ordinary reality, living in the realm of the spirits—just as my mother most valued. And just as in childhood, I couldn’t describe anything about what I was learning to those who weren’t initiated. When I was a graduate student at MIT, I could tell people that my master’s thesis was about homotopy colimits, but if they weren’t already mathematicians, I couldn’t tell them what a homotopy colimit was.</p>
<p>Graduate school, however, pulverized me. My professors seemed… not human. I could find no point of connection. My male colleagues seemed to fit in far better than I did. And the thing I most valued about myself mathematically—my ability and determination to understand mathematics deeply, from the ground up, grasping its interconnections and deep structure—seemed to be viewed only as slowness and boneheadedness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: The Circus</h2>
<p>My conclusion was that the messiness of these diseases confounded many ordinary scientific processes. And then scientists, who are commonly drawn to their fields because they like clarity and certainty, often respond by pushing the illness into the semi-scientific realm of psychosomatic illness. That dismissal sets up a self-reinforcing network of interactions. Researchers, doctors, and the public all view the illness with scorn; research funding isn’t made available; academic researchers become disinterested; medical societies spread bad information; doctors don’t know how to best treat their patients. Each element weaves around the others, tightening into an inescapable knot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just three years after the institute opened, in 2009, Whittemore’s greatest dream seemed to come true when Judy Mikovits, the institute’s lead researcher, found the retrovirus XMRV in most ME/CFS patients and a few healthy controls. She published the finding in <em>Science</em><label for="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">16</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">16</span> Vincent C. Lombardi, et al., “Detection of an Infectious Retrovirus, XMRV, in Blood Cells of Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,” <em>Science</em> 326, no. 5952 (October 2009): 585–89.</span>.</p>
<p>The result had a stunning implication: The nation’s blood supply might be at risk. Retroviruses, the best known of which is HIV, spread through blood—which means they can infect anyone, not just crazy, psychosomatic people. And because retroviruses infiltrate the DNA of their victims, scientists know of no way to cure them. Doctors can at best keep them at bay. XMRV might be an enormous threat to the health of everyone.</p>
<p>Many patients exulted, especially those who had suspected a virus or retrovirus for decades. Although my illness had crept up on me, many people seem to get a sudden, terrible bug they never recover from. Naturally, many patients longed to know if they themselves were infected with XMRV, and they clamored for testing. The Whittemore Peterson Institute obliged. A laboratory linked to them produced a $500 commercial test, and patients began raiding their social security checks to send in their blood.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the threat to the blood supply opened the taps of research funding, and scientists rushed to replicate Mikovits’s finding. But they soon got inconsistent results. Mikovits belligerently defended her work, and the laboratory continued to sell its unvalidated XMRV tests to patients.</p>
<p>Finally, a definitive study showed that the XMRV in the blood samples came from laboratory contamination rather than an infection in patients.<label for="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">17</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">17</span> On December 22, 2011, three weeks after my <em>Slate</em> story appeared, Mikovits’s <em>Science</em> article was formally retracted.</span></p>
<p>Then things really got messy. The Whittemore Peterson Institute fired Mikovits in a dispute over who controlled her lab samples. Soon after, Mikovits’s former research assistant, on her request, secreted critical lab notebooks out of the building to her. The institute pressed charges against her for theft and she was arrested, appearing in chains in a California courtroom. She ultimately returned the notebooks, and the charges were dropped.</p>
<p>Of course, this was media catnip, and as usual, most of the coverage made me groan. A Wired article that appeared shortly before mine yet again trotted out the claims that Wessely and others had received death threats and concluded that while Mikovits and ME/CFS patients had behaved badly, science had functioned beautifully. Governmental scientific institutions, journals, outside researchers—all deserved a big clap on the back. The article ended without so much as a thought for the patients still ailing, still without answers, still without serious research. A dagger of rage toward my fellow journalists regarding the PACE trial had grown inside me, and it twisted painfully as I read this.</p>
<p>To me, the toxic history led directly to the current mess. I pointed out in my own article that many patients felt that Mikovits wasn’t just an ordinary scientist, trying to do the extremely difficult task of wrenching answers from nature’s grasp. She was their redeemer, the sole defender of the theory that might rescue more than a million desperately ill Americans. In the context of such need and desperation, both some patients and many in the press conflated the legitimacy of the retrovirus research with public acceptance of ME/CFS as a “real” disease. Patients without deep familiarity with the scientific process had little idea how essential and uncertain replication was.</p>
<p>It seemed likely that being the object of such desperate adulation had an intoxicating effect on Mikovits. Patients’ fervor may well have fueled that of Mikovits, convincing her that she was the only one left standing up for patients and supercharging her initial enthusiasm for the work into self-righteous certainty. It was easy to imagine how her sense of obligation to produce results quickly for desperate patients, and the polarized atmosphere around ME/CFS research, could have greased the slide she took from cautious science into reckless overreaching.</p>
<p>I argued in my story that whatever the failings of Mikovits, Whittemore’s institute, or the patients who trusted them, they weren’t the point. With a disease this debilitating and marginalized, some patients are bound to make leaps of faith; some researchers might start to believe their own press; and a mother might overextend herself in her quest to save her child. But the alienation of the patient community only arose because of the mishandling of ME/CFS by the public agencies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Writing the piece nearly killed me. My editor was convinced that the disease was a “real, psychiatric illness” and didn’t understand why patients were so resistant to that idea. At one point, he threatened to hire someone to rebut my piece if I didn’t make the tone less polemical—which nearly made me despair, since I’d already asked several writer buddies to read my draft to help me excise any angry notes in it. The editor insisted that I add a mention of the death threats, and when I pointed out that these death threats were little more than a rumor since they were entirely unsubstantiated, he told me I nevertheless had to include them to make the piece appear “fair-minded and balanced.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 11: An Unlikely Hypothesis</h2>
<p><em>La la la</em>, I thought. <em>Nice story</em>. People occasionally recovered in all kinds of weird ways: cough medicine, a device that zaps electricity through your wrist, homeopathy. Anyone who managed to get better attributed their success to something, and then they often became convinced that that something was the cure for everyone with the disease.</p>
<p>I dipped into the 900-page tome I had been sent, which turned out to be a compilation of Erik the Mold Warrior’s posts in various online forums. But as I read more of the book and the e-mail list, I often thought these people sounded like total wackos. For one thing, their theories got unbelievably elaborate. Mold, they said, occurred in plumes outside, so that you could suddenly be hit by one just walking down the street. Mold sometimes couldn’t be seen or smelled or detected in any way, except that it could make people sick. “Ick” was apparently undetectable to scientific instruments (but not to moldies!). There were suggestions that mold might cause nearly every malady known to man. People described reacting to their husbands, to their hair, to their own sweat. At one point, the patients began discussing the evils of airplane contrails and vaccines, and I felt a surge of anger at the universe. <em>Really? I’m reduced to seriously considering the ideas of people who believe crap like this?</em></p>

<p>Now, though, plunked in my camp chair in Death Valley, achieving “success” seemed absurdly beyond my capabilities. <em>So much effort</em>, I thought. <em>I quit!</em> Just taking one breath after another, managing to heat up my food and wash my dishes, occasionally sweeping the sand out of the tent—that felt like success enough for me. With all my assumed obligations removed, life seemed unimaginably spacious. Just being alive was a thrill, a blessing, a tiny miracle beyond my expectation or control. Anything I managed to accomplish above that was a gift.</p>
<p>One day a few months before my mother died, she told me, “I’m not worried about you anymore. You’ve learned everything you needed to from me. Now, I just want you to be happy. That’s the only thing I’m not sure of—that you’ll be happy.” I’d been stunned. Happy? I’d never heard her talk much about happiness before. A statement that might be banal from most people was, from her, astonishing, a benediction.</p>
<p>But the truth was, she’d been right to be concerned about me on that score—I hadn’t been very happy. Oddly, now that I was abandoning my perceived obligation to my mother, I was at last fulfilling her final wish for me.</p>
<p>I thought about that strange feeling I’d had that I was going to the desert to die. Perhaps now I knew what that feeling had meant. Yes, I was still breathing, but I had reached the end of everything I had worked so hard for all my life. The path I’d been following had evaporated beneath my feet, carrying the world I had known with it. I was now standing in a vast blankness, trusting that the world would form itself beneath me as I walked forward.</p>

<p><em>Am I in a poltergeist movie?</em> I resisted an urge to snicker. <em>But, okay, I haven’t come this far to give this stupid theory anything less than a full shot.</em> So I paid close attention to my body: Could I feel anything different? Was that a constriction in my heart? Perhaps a slight pain, maybe the needle-in-the-heart feeling I’d heard my online moldie friends describe? <em>Could be, I thought, but then again, it could be a random sensation I would never even have noticed if I weren’t paying such close attention.</em></p>

<p>I woke up in the middle of the night needing to pee. I felt awful. When I got up, I found that not only could I barely walk, I couldn’t even stand up straight. I hadn’t had trouble walking since I’d left Santa Fe.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god! It might be true! I might be a moldie!</em></p>

<div id="chapter-16-a-wake-and-a-baptism" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 16: A Wake and a Baptism</h2>
<p>I settled into a pattern of doing coffee enemas first thing in the morning, since I typically felt muddleheaded and achy when I first woke up. Over and over, I was amazed to find that an enema (or two or three) brought me fully to the world again. <em>I don’t know if this is really detoxifying me, but it sure as hell is doing something remarkable</em>.</p>
<p>I found this so astonishing that I spent some time looking for scientific papers about it. I found a reference to a study of coffee enemas in rats. <em>Really? They were injecting coffee up rats’ butts?</em> It turned out that they gave 15 rats suppositories with one of the many compounds that occur in coffee and found that their livers produced more bile afterward. <em>Okay</em>, I thought, <em>but it’s tiny, it’s in rats, it’s not really a coffee enema, and it hasn’t been followed up on. Big whoop</em>. A study of 11 patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer found that a program of coffee enemas along with bazillions of supplements extended their lives dramatically, but a follow-up study by an outside group catastrophically failed to replicate the result. That was pretty much all I found. So the benefits of coffee enemas were certainly scientifically unproven—but then, they were also almost entirely untested.</p>
<p>I encountered emphatic denunciations of coffee enemas from Web sites claiming the mantle of being scientific, like Quackwatch and Science-Based Medicine. The latter said flatly, “Given the lack of benefit and potential harms, there is no plausible justification to undergo these treatments.<label for="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">18</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">18</span> Scott Gavura, “Ask the (Science-Based) Pharmacist: What are the benefits of coffee enemas?” <em>Science-Based Medicine</em>, July 11, 2013, <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ask-the-science-based-pharmacist-what-are-the-benefits-of-coffee-enemas/">URL</a>.</span>” But when I investigated those harms, I found only about a dozen reports, generally from disapproving doctors. Several were about people who did so many coffee enemas they became dehydrated and electrolyte-depleted; one was about someone who used boiling water (cringe); another managed to puncture his colon (double cringe); a couple used amoeba-infected water; others were people so sick that the problem may or may not have been caused by the enemas at all. The only reports I found disturbing were two in which people acquired colon infections after doing a single enema—but given how many people seemed to be doing them, and how few reports there were of that, I couldn’t work up too much alarm.</p>
<p>So basically, science failed to shed any light. And the evidence that the enemas made me personally feel better was extremely strong—though I had no idea whether the mechanism was indeed through detoxification. Over time, my preferred theory was that they somehow reduced inflammation, but with no scientific studies to go on, I was (ahem) talking out of my butt. I could have strengthened the evidence by testing it against a placebo (say, comparing it with a water enema), but with no objective way to measure improvement, it would shed no light on the mechanism. And frankly, I didn’t much care. The effect was so profound that even if it was a placebo, that was good enough for me—though if so, I did wish my brain had chosen a more convenient and less embarrassing treatment for its preferred placebo.</p>
<p>The uncertainty took a toll on me, though. Each time I inserted that nozzle into my butt or sweated in a sauna or downed supplements with uncertain efficacy, I felt like I was taking one more step away from the world my science-writer friends lived in, and one step further into this new, warped universe.</p>

<div id="chapter-19-moldy-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 19: Moldy Science</h2>
<p>Scientists investigated, and they realized that the buildings had dangerous levels of toxins in their indoor air. Chemicals were leaking out of building supplies, outdoor pollution was accumulating in dust, mold was chomping through damp drywall and flinging its spores into the air—and with the buildings sealed up so tightly, all these nasties built up in the indoor air over time. Scientists patiently put together the clues and saw a clear signal that mold could cause or exacerbate serious allergies and asthma.</p>
<p>This was all part of the orderly, calm process of science—until the mid-1990s. Dorr Dearborn, a pediatric pulmonologist in Cleveland, Ohio, treated a string of babies with bleeding lungs in 1993. The condition is ordinarily very rare: Dearborn had seen only three cases in the previous 10 years. But within a year and a half, 10 cases came to his clinic, and three of the babies died. Some recovered in the hospital, only to relapse after they went home. All the babies were from a single, low-income area of Cleveland that had been flooded.</p>
<p>As the cases piled up, Dearborn grew alarmed and contacted the CDC. Ruth Etzel, the branch chief of air pollution and respiratory health, came to investigate. Together, Dearborn and Etzel compared the sick babies with healthy ones to examine possible explanations: Could the babies have been exposed to pesticides intended to treat cockroaches? Perhaps they were breathed fumes from crack cocaine, second hand? Cigarettes? Child abuse? None of these possibilities seemed like plausible explanations, but one thing stood out: All the babies lived in extremely moldy homes. The homes were contaminated with <em>Stachybotrys chartarum</em>, the particularly nasty strain of mold that had killed the Soviet horses long ago. Spore levels of <em>Stachybotrys</em> were 3,000 times higher in the homes of the sick babies than the healthy ones.</p>
<p>The media, naturally, freaked out. One AP headline read “Baby-Killing Fungus.”<label for="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">19</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">19</span> July 31, 1997</span> An article in the <em>Plain Dealer</em> newspaper claimed that health officials were “99 percent certain” that <em>Stachybotrys</em> had killed the babies (though Dearborn and Etzel never made such a claim, only saying there was an association between the illness and the mold).</p>
<p>In 1999, even as Dearborn and Etzel were continuing to investigate the cases that kept appearing in Dearborn’s clinic—close to 30 in seven years—the CDC launched a second investigation by an anonymous panel.<label for="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">20</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">20</span> Reports of Members of the CDC External Expert Panel on Acute Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemorrhage in Infants: A Synthesis,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, December 1999, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mold/pdfs/aiphi_report.pdf">URL</a>.</span> It reported that Dearborn and Etzel’s work had “serious shortcomings,” criticized the methods of the CDC’s own statisticians, and concluded that “the postulated associations should be considered, at best, not proven.”</p>
<p>The CDC’s decision to undermine its own ongoing investigation struck many as quite unusual, even bizarre. Nicholas Money, a highly regarded mycologist at Miami University, reviewed the controversy in his book <em>Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores: A Natural History of Toxic Mold</em>.<label for="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">21</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">21</span> Nicholas P. Money, <em>Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores: A Natural History of Toxic Mold</em> (London: Oxford University Press, 2004). I highly recommend this book despite its rather overheated title—it manages to simultaneously be scientifically sober and quite entertaining.</span> Although Money agreed that Dearborn and Etzel’s study had some shortcomings, he argued that most of the criticisms in the reevaluation were baseless. Money concluded, “I don’t know if <em>Stachybotrys</em> is guilty of killing babies, but I think its presence in the homes of IPH [lung bleeding] patients is more than pure coincidence.”</p>
<p>The Cleveland bleeding lung case alerted the world that mold could pose serious dangers, and lawyers perked up their ears.</p>
<p>When I realized that special interests were powerful enough to override science in official statements from professional organizations, I saw the CDC’s reversal on the Cleveland bleeding lung cases in a different light. In an argument I found persuasive, Nicholas Money, the mycologist and book author, speculated on the reasons the CDC might have chosen to take on a second, highly skeptical investigation<label for="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">22</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">22</span> Nicholas P. Money, <em>Carpet Monsters and Killer Spores: A Natural History of Toxic Mold</em> (London: Oxford University Press, 2004).</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The potential for insurance claims by homeowners maintaining that they were sickened by mold exposure is astronomical. The prospect of a peer-reviewed scientific article demonstrating a clear association between Stachybotrys and human illness must have kept plenty of insurance agents awake at night, and also made attorneys salivate. Also, everyone is aware that the insurance industry donates a great deal of money to finance political campaigns. The CDC is a government agency. I presume, then, that somebody made a phone call from Washington, DC, to Atlanta [the location of CDC headquarters] and told the CDC to shut those meddling scientists down in Ohio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This possibility seemed even more plausible when I learned that a few months before the CDC initiated its 1999 reinvestigation of the Cleveland babies, the agency got a new director: Jeffrey Koplan, who came to the agency from the research arm of Prudential, a large insurance company.<label for="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">23</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">23</span> Biography: Jeffery P.

<div id="chapter-20-crazy-neurological-people" class="section level2">
<h2>Chapter 20: Crazy Neurological People</h2>
<p>Ammann explained that one of the biggest arguments against problems from mycotoxins had been that many researchers didn’t think you could breathe enough of them in to poison you. But recently, they’d realized they’d been calculating exposure levels the wrong way. They’d been collecting air from moldy buildings and then counted the number of intact spores, which, like plant seeds, can germinate into new mold colonies. They then calculated the amount of mycotoxin each spore could carry, and the total quantity of mycotoxins seemed awfully low. Admittedly, nobody really knew how much mycotoxin it took to poison people, especially people who were exposed day after day and month after month. But still, this had made many researchers skeptical.</p>
<p>It turned out, though, that whole spores weren’t the only things that mattered. Mycotoxins also oozed onto broken spores and tiny fragments of the mold itself and surrounding dust, all of which could float in the air. When environmental health researcher Tiina Reponen of the University of Cincinnati looked for these fragments, she found between 1,000 and 1,000,000 times more of them than intact spores.<label for="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">24</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">24</span> Tiina Reponen, et al., “Fungal Fragments in Moldy Houses: A Field Study in Homes in New Orleans and Southern Ohio,” <em>Atmospheric Environment</em> 41, no. 37 (December 2007): 8140–49.</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, researchers had begun to realize that air pollution as a whole could cause systemic effects, not just the respiratory ones they’d long recognized. It had recently been linked to diabetes<label for="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">25</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">25</span> Salynn Boyles, “Air Pollution Linked to Risk of Diabetes: Study Suggests a Diabetes Risk Even at ‘Acceptable’ Exposure Levels,” WebMD, October 1, 2010, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20101001/air-pollution-linked-to-diabetes-risk">URL</a>.</span>, heart disease<label for="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">26</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">26</span> Ibid</span>, and dementia<label for="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">27</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">27</span> Clayton Aldern, “Meet the scientist connecting the dots between air pollution and dementia,” Grist, February 17, 2016, <a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/meet-the-scientist-connecting-the-dots-between-air-pollution-and-dementia/">URL</a>.</span>. The mechanisms for these associations were unclear, but many researchers fingered inflammation as a likely culprit.</p>
<p>Mycotoxins can travel from our noses, along our olfactory nerves, and straight into the brain, James Pestka of Michigan State University and his colleagues had found.<label for="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">28</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">28</span> Somehow, the notion of molecules traveling along a nerve sounded immensely implausible to me—I was convinced that only electrical signals could travel along nerves. I checked references Ammann gave me, and indeed, this is an established fact. This is one of the ways that air pollution may increase dementia risk. And pharmaceutical companies are eyeing this pathway as a route to deliver drugs. Intranasal insulin, for example, may provide a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, since insulin levels in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients are thought to be low. Using the olfactory nerve to deliver the drug would, potentially, raise insulin levels in the brain without affecting the rest of the body.</span> This route acts as a molecular version of TSA PreCheck, speeding mycotoxins past the blood-brain barrier that ordinarily would flag them as potential terrorists. When monkeys breathed mycotoxins from Stachybotrys chartarum, they lost their sense of smell, neurons in their olfactory bulbs died, and their brains grew inflamed. Similar particles, studies had shown, could travel past the olfactory bulbs to the rest of the brain.</p>
<p>Whether this happens in humans from quantities of mycotoxins they absorb in moldy buildings wasn’t clear—the monkeys received very large doses. But repeated exposures had a vicious cumulative effect: Monkeys who received five micrograms of the toxin each day for four days showed even more damage than ones who received 20 micrograms at once<label for="tufte-sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">29</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-29" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">29</span> S.

It may be, then, that breathing still smaller quantities day after day could be similarly harmful.</p>
<p>When I talked to Pestka, Harding, and Bennett, the researchers who had uncovered these new mechanisms, all reported they had given up their research because they couldn’t get funding to continue it. They had each repeatedly sent grant applications to the NIH that had been denied, and they’d concluded that the NIH was simply not interested in research into non-respiratory effects of mold. Pestka had returned to studying ingested mycotoxins. Harding had retired but was continuing work to finish and publish her research. Bennett had turned to studying the positive effects of mold VOCs.</p>
<p>Some mold researchers were getting funded, though—the ones studying respiratory effects. So I turned to them, figuring they must have some perspective on the range of possible impacts of mold. I often found, though, that as soon as the words “mycotoxin” or “neurological” passed through my mouth, I felt as though I could hear their eyes rolling through the telephone. Many adamantly argued that there weren’t enough mycotoxins in the air in moldy buildings to make people sick.</p>
<p>When I got off the phone, I felt like a refugee, my citizenship in the land of science having been unceremoniously revoked. I felt like I was as trapped as the snake eating its tail: The way to reclaim my citizenship was to agree to the perspective that Miller had presented with such genial authority. But Miller’s claim was that the science was clear—even though it couldn’t explain experiences like mine, which he acknowledged occur regularly. So accepting that thrust me and my kind back into exile.</p>
<p>Thinking back on his comments about the Mold Wars and the ACOEM statement, I felt like I had a clue. I imagined him as a young researcher, steadily accumulating solid scientific evidence to prove the respiratory dangers of mold—only to be ignored in the legal clashes, with unscientific claims made on both sides and his own careful evidence getting disregarded. In his shoes, I might want to scream, “Ignore those crazy insurance people! Ignore those crazy neurological people! Listen to me! I’m the one with the science!”</p>
<p>Miller and his researcher comrades had finally won the war against the crazy insurance people. But I could imagine it being very hard to then open the door to the crazy neurological people in order to see how science could be used to investigate their claims. Much safer to keep the focus on the core issues, the ones where we already had solid results, the ones that seemed to affect vastly greater numbers of people. Especially when the mechanism for neurological problems was unclear, and when it was so easy to imagine that they were just a nocebo effect.</p>
<p>Plus, from Miller’s point of view, he’d succeeded. He’d established that mold in buildings was a human health threat and that mold levels needed to be as low as possible. He was done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22: Rebirthday</h2>
<p>Timmy asked what I would say to that little girl now, if I could, and I came up with this: “You are so radiant, and you do so much for your mother simply by being who you are. It’s not your job to make her happy or meet her needs, even if she thinks it is. Nor is it your job to save your brother. Your only job is to be your own beautiful little self, and in so doing, you are helping your mother and your brother, tremendously. And, my god, you are brave. You are so, so brave. It’s going to take a while, but someday, you won’t have to be quite so brave.”</p>
<p>I imagined me now, or my “higher self,” going back in time and holding the child me, dissolving time and telling her that whenever she needs me, she can call on me and I’ll be there for her. I could feel her wiry body melting in my lap, snuggling against me like Frances did. I told her that yes, there were terrible things that would inevitably happen, but even so, she was safe. She would hurt, but still, she’d be okay. Profoundly okay.</p>
<p>As we were ending the session, I wasn’t sure what had come from it. What does it mean to process trauma anyway? Was I in any way different after this than I was before—and what difference could I hope for? I didn’t feel any different.</p>
<p>But it also struck me as a reasonable-enough approach, and something that was generally useful, not so different from what a therapist might do. I’d talked about these events with therapists in the past, but it hadn’t included the breathing exercises or the visualizations about my “higher self.” I’d liked those aspects of the session, and maybe they’d been helpful.</p>
<p>I was definitely aware of the mold—it felt a bit like a swarm of gnats inside my head, buzzing away—but the weakness and dimming-of-consciousness was gone. The mold wasn’t felling me. It was nothing more than an irritation.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god. I think it worked. I may have been healed by a psychic.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 23: Psychic Science</h2>
<p>Deckersbach’s theory was that Timmy had given me the courage to stay in the moldy hotel lobby longer than I would have otherwise. I had discovered that the mold didn’t harm me as I expected, and that had decreased my anxiety and hence my future reactions.</p>
<p>What made more sense to me is that mold attacked my body, and it would have even if I’d had the easiest of childhoods. But whatever our inner vulnerabilities, they may end up relevant in a situation like this. When my body was under attack, it felt like an even bigger attack because I felt unprotected and profoundly alone, based on my childhood experiences. And it seemed reasonable to me that internalizing a sense of protection and connection helped reset my body, reducing the physiological perception of threat. This reduction, I thought, was the essence of Timmy’s “psychic beta-blocker.”</p>
