<h3 class="subtitle">Or the Altogether Factual, Wholly Bona Fide Story of a Big Dreams, Hard Luck, American-Made Mad Kid</h3>

<p>“It’s okay,” I say. “You don’t have to be real to matter. I mean, it helps, but it’s not a requirement.”</p>
<p>Again The Kid laughs. “Why am I not real?”</p>
<p>“Because I have a condition. I see things. People too. They say it’s a sort of escape valve for pressure on the mind, probably caused by some sort of trauma. But I don’t go in on that. I haven’t had any type of trauma in my life. I mean, yeah, I’ve had my fair share of bad luck, but nothing big. Nothing worthy of a Lifetime network movie or anything like that. Know what I mean?”</p>
<p>“Haha! Nah. That ain’t it. Seeing stuff that’s not there… that’s what crazy people do. And you ain’t crazy.”</p>
<p>“It’s always good when a figment of your own imagination reassures you that you’re not crazy.”</p>

<p>“Well?” Renny says, turning his attention from the youth who believe their lives matter and back to me.</p>
<p>“Well what?”</p>
<p>“Well, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a tragedy,” I say with confidence.</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And what?”</p>
<p>“And what do you think about it, State College? You’re a writer. You’re supposed to say something about these things. And you’re Black!”</p>
<p>“Am I?” I ask. I look down at my arm and, sure enough, it turns out that Renny is right. I’m Black!</p>
<p>A startling discovery to make this far along!</p>
<p>“Well now,” I say, staring at the black hand at the end of my black arm and the black fingers adorning it. “That’s very, very interesting. I wonder if my readers know that.”</p>
<p>“So what do you think about it?” Renny asks. “What do you have to say about it all?”</p>
<p>I really do want to answer Renny’s question, but I’m still processing my sudden Blackness. How long have I been Black? When did it happen? Was I born that way? If so, why don’t I remember it? Or maybe this is all just another part of my condition. Maybe I’m not Black and I’m imagining it. Or maybe I’ve been Black my whole life and my condition showed me something other than that?</p>
<p>I try to look back on my life and find my Blackness. Were my parents Black? My cousins? Come to think about it, I feel like I remember having a Black uncles. I think. It’s all so fuzzy. It’s all so much to think about. And what about my agent? Does she know I’m Black? My readers? Do they know? And what if Renny’s right? What if my being black is something that means I’m supposed to do everything differently?</p>
<p>“You’re not supposed to just stand there,” Renny barks, shaking a fist. “You’re supposed to say something. You’re supposed to speak about the Black condition! You’re supposed to be a voice!”</p>
<p>“A voice? What voice? The voice of my people? Always? Every second of every day of my life? That’s what Black people are always supposed to be? And the Black condition? What kind of condition is that? You mean as in an existing state of being? Or a condition as in a state of health—like an illness?”</p>
<p>Renny shakes his head. “I just can’t believe you,” he says in a tone that reminds me of my disappointed father. “Here you are, a famous writer, and a wonderful writer. Your book… it’s just a hell of a book.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s a hell of a book. You’ve got a gift for words. You’ve got the ability to say things that others can’t say. You can pull out the things that other people have all trapped up inside of them. And it’s clear that you can do it. Your book hit me in my heart!” He thumps his small fist against his narrow chest. “But there wasn’t anything about the Black condition in it. There wasn’t anything about <em>being</em> Black.”</p>
<p>I consider Renny’s words and I look down at my black hands. “Do I have to write about being Black? What if I were an artist that only drew White characters? What would that say about me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, White writers don’t have to write about being White. They can just write whatever books they want. But because I’m Black…” I pause to look at my hands and reaffirm that, yes, I really am Black. The story checks out. “… does that mean that I can only ever write about Blackness? Am I allowed to write about other things? Am I allowed to be something other than simply the color of my skin? I mean, I can’t quote it word for word, but isn’t that what the whole ‘I Have a Dream’ speech was about?”</p>
<p>Renny’s as quiet as an empty bourbon barrel.</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m not saying you’re wrong, Renny. I’m just saying that I don’t know. This is all new to me. This is all fresh and if I’m honest, maybe even exciting?” Renny’s left eyebrow arches toward the heavens. “No, hear me out,” I continue. “Every day of a person’s life they live it in the same way, over and over again. There’s a pattern, a routine to it. A way of doing things that all boils down to a type of white noise hissing in the background of their minds every day. They know everything about themselves. When they go to look in the mirror, they know exactly what they’re signing up for.</p>
<p>“But here I am, today, in this moment, finding out I’m Black. A Negro! A bona fide African American! Hell of a discovery. And if I’ve always been Black—which, as I’m thinking about my life, I think might be the case—then I wonder what it’s done to me. I wonder how it’s guided my life. Like, what decisions have I made that I wouldn’t have made if I wasn’t Black? And what’s about the rest of the world? What has everyone seen in me and thought about me because I’m Black that I didn’t see and think about myself?”</p>
<p>I rub my chin in contemplation.</p>
<p>“It’s a hell of an enigma, Renny, my man. The kind of thing that doesn’t come along often. A puzzle wrapped in a riddle in chewy nougat. I’ve got to savor the taste of it. Savor the moment. I’ve got to let it sink in. Got to let it really become a part of me. Gotta steep in it like tea in water.”</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what the old man wanted. To live that kind of life. I’m older now. Seen a few things. And, looking back on it, I think my pops was afraid. Always afraid. Every second of every day. His whole life was one long, sustained terror that he tried with all of his might to keep to himself. Not just to keep it secret, but to keep ownership of it. He wanted to be selfish with it.</p>
<p>I think it was always running, my old man’s fear. Perpetual and widespread.</p>
<p>Fear of being a bad father. Fear of being a bad husband. Fear of being arrested. Fear of being called skinny like when he was a kid. Fear of being poorer tomorrow than he was today. Fear of giving too much of his life to swing shift and not enough to his son. Fear of cops. Fear of lawyers. Fear of getting injured. Fear of dying. Fear of living. Fear of a past that he couldn’t change. Fear of a present that was always out to get him. Fear of getting injured. Fear of dying. Fear of living. Fear of a past that he couldn’t change. Fear of a presente that was always out to get him. Fear of a future that might turn out to be nothing more than the present with more gray hair. Same failures. Same struggles. All of it with fewer chances to get it right.</p>
<p>Every day he wore his fears just like he wore those Dickies of his.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“You’re terrified right now. Scared all the way down to your socks. Because at some point you saw yourself on that little box in your living room—the same one that brought me into your world—and you started to believe the things you were told by people who truly didn’t know you and were terrified of you. You saw pictures of yourself in prison, in riots, shooting other people who look like you, sacrificing yourself to the bloodthirsty monster just to save the hero—who looks nothing like you, by the way. And when you saw it all it built up a story in your brain, a story so convincing that it eventually swallowed up reality itself. And you started to think: ‘Shit. Maybe that really is who I am. Maybe I really am the socionarrative villain.’ And that’s when it happened.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked, breathless.</p>
<p>“You became terrified of yourself. You became afraid of your own voice. And I think you still are.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit,” I managed.</p>
<p>“Damn right,” he said. “See. That right there. That’s the thing. That’s the moment! You just realized that maybe what you heard about me isn’t true, which means I’m an unknown. And you also realized that maybe what you’ve heard about yourself isn’t true, and realized that maybe you’re an unknown, even to yourself.” He shook his head. “That’s some terrifying shit.”</p>
<p>“So what do I do about it?” I asked.</p>
<p>In my gut, I was on my knees. It had finally happened. The universe had given me a guide. My very own Virgil, willing to lead me out from the underworld of my existence.</p>
<p>And then Mr. <em>Drive Angry</em> did the worst thing ever. He just sat there and said nothing. With that tall, smooth forehead, with those slightly sunken eyes that know how to go crazy like nobody else’s. He sat there and waited for me to unravel whatever in the hell he’d just told me all on my own.</p>
<p>If I’m square with you, I hated him a little bit right then. He had one job: be who I expected him to be. Let me feel good about myself. But, shit, that doesn’t seem to be the theme of my life when I get right down to it. He had single-handedly spoiled my meeting of him. Had put the full kibosh on my entire Cage-view. It would have been easier if he’d just let me sign his book and let me have what I thought I knew of him.</p>
<p>I wanted to wake him. I wanted to continue our conversation. I wanted to have someone—anyone—solve the riddle I understood the least: the riddle of my existence, the riddle of my skin and my mind. But I knew it wouldn’t do any good. So there I was, across from a sleeping prophecy, holding a book that he would carry with him, a book I was supposed to say something profound.</p>
<p>So I did the best I could. I signed what I always sign when I autograph a copy of <em>Hell of a Book</em>. It’s the only thing that makes sense, so I write it, again and again and again, I burn it into every copy of my book that I touch. I just change the name at the beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Lord of War:</p>
<p>The whole world of my life spins under a radiant marquee of fear. Day in and day out it kills me, over and over and over again. Kills me dead, just to restart it all tomorrow. And all I can do about it is tell people that I’m fine.</p>
<p>“Thanks for reading.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by a smiley face.</p>
