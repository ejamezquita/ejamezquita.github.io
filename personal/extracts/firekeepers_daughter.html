<div id="i-waabanong-east" class="section level1">
<h1>(I) Waabanong [East]</h1>
<p><strong>In Ojibwe teachings, all journeys begin in the Eastern direction.</strong></p>
<div id="section" class="section level2">
<h2>1</h2>
<p>I start my day before sunrise, throwing on running clothes and laying a pinch of semaa at the eastern base of a tree, where sunlight will touch the tobacco first. Prayers begin with offering semaa and sharing my Spirit name, clan, and where I am from. I always add an extra name to make sure Creator knows who I am. A name that connects me to my father—because I began as a secret, and then a scandal.</p>
<p>I give thanks to Creator and ask for zoongidewin, because I’ll need courage for what I have to do after my five-mile run. I’ve put it off for a week.</p>
<p>“Ziisabaaka Minising.” I whisper in Anishinaabemowin the name for the island, which my father taught me when I was little. It sounds like a prayer. My father’s family, the Firekeeper side, is as much a part of Sugar Island as its spring-fed streams and sugar maple trees.</p>
<p>Gramma Pearl—my Anishinaabe nokomis on my Firekeeper side—considered a bird flying into a window a bad sign. She would rush outside, one leathered brown hand at her mouth, muttering “uh-uh-oh” at its crooked neck before calling her sisters to figure out which tragedy was just around the corner.</p>
<p>But GrandMary would say it was random and unfortunate. Nothing more than an unintended consequence of a clean window. Indian superstitions are not facts, Daunis.</p>
<p>My Zhaaganaash and Anishinaabe grandmothers could not have been more different. One viewed the world as its surface, while the other saw connections and teachings that run deeper than our known world. Their push and pull on me has been a tug-of-war my entire life.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level2">
<h2>3</h2>
<p>I remember how, as a kid, I once fell hard, my helmet smacking the ice. Dad was at my side in an instant, deep voice booming, <em>N’Daunis, bazigonjisen!</em> I scrambled to stand while my eyes saw stars. <em>That’s my girl!</em></p>
<p>“He died a few months ago. It was awful.” I correct myself. “It’s still awful.”</p>
<p>When someone dies, everything about them becomes past tense. Except for the grief. Grief stays in the present.</p>
<p>It’s even worse when you’re angry at the person. Not just for dying. But for how.</p>
<p>“In Ojibwe culture, the owl is a companion for crossing over when you die,” I explain. “Not exactly the ambassador you want telling Nish parents to immunize their babies.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-2" class="section level2">
<h2>4</h2>
<p>“I don’t remember fairness being one of the Seven Grandfathers,” Auntie says.</p>
<p>The Seven Grandfathers are teachings about living the Anishinaabe minobimaadiziwin—our good way of life—through love, humility, respect, honesty, bravery, wisdom, and truth. I include one in my prayers each morning to help me become a strong Nish kwe like my aunt.</p>
<p>I’m definitely local.</p>
<p>Yet even with such deep roots, I don’t always feel like I belong. Each time my Fontaine grandparents or their friends have seen my Ojibwe side as a flaw or a burden to overcome. And the less frequent but more heartbreaking instances when my Firekeeper family sees me as a Fontaine first and one of them second. When they say things about the Zhaaganaash and then, a beat later, remember that I’m in the room too. It’s hard to explain what it’s like being so connected to everyone and everything here… yet feeling that no one ever sees the whole me.</p>
<p>A blanket party is when a guy does something bad to a woman and her female cousins take him into the woods, rolled in a blanket, and beat the moowin out of him. I asked Auntie when I first heard about it; she called it Nish kwe justice. Lily and I made a pact that if either of us finally got to attend one, we’d tell the other about it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-3" class="section level2">

<p>And welcome to Sault Sainte Marie.” I gesture like a game-show hostess. “Now, don’t be like tourists and pronounce it like <em>Salt</em>. It’s <em>Soo</em>.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-4" class="section level2">

<p>Ships pass by on their way to or from the other Great Lakes to reach Lake Superior, which is twenty-something feet higher than everything downriver. There used to be rapids here. It was a major gathering spot for Anishinaabeg, with fishing villages on both sides of the river and on Sugar Island. The government took over the area and cut through the rapids to build the Soo Locks, which work like a water elevator to raise or lower the ships.”</p>
<p>Jamie’s eyes are on me instead of the freighter across the street. “What happened to all the Anishinaabeg people and their villages?”</p>
<p>I raise an eyebrow. I’m not sure if Jamie knows what a big question he’s asked. Tourists like Jamie never think about the ones who got pushed aside for progress. I don’t know if he really wants to know my tribe’s history, or how I’d even begin to tell him.</p>
<p>“What’s the deal with ‘yous’?” Jamie asks.</p>
<p>I laugh. “Ah, that’s the most important question. Yous is the Yooper version of y’all.”</p>
<p>“That’s where my uncle and I live,” he says, continuing to run beside me. “Oh, one more question. When people say Anishinaabe, do they mean Native or Ojibwe?”</p>
<p>“Anishinaabe means the Original People. Indigenous. Nish. Nishnaab. Shinaab. Mostly we’re referring to Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi tribes from the Great Lakes area. Ojibwe language is called Anishinaabemowin or Ojibwemowin. Levi calls it Ojiberish.” I roll my eyes. “If you hang with him long enough, he’ll give you a Nish nickname.”</p>
<p>I want to know everything. My prayer this morning, though, was for manaadendamowin. Respect. Respect for relationships—my ambassador thing with Jamie and his relationship with his girlfriend. I won’t be a wannabe anglerfish, trying to latch on to a guy who is already taken.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5" class="section level2">

<p>Lily is… somewhere. By now, Auntie and Seeney Nimkee will have washed her body with cedar water. Even if Seeney didn’t work for the Traditional Medicine Program, Granny June would have asked her to prepare Lily for the four-day journey to the next world. It isn’t part of Auntie’s job as Tribal Health director, but I know she will assist Seeney.</p>
<p>Each day has a purpose. Today, Lily’s first day, she will mourn her family. Loved ones.</p>
<p>Me. She will mourn me. I can’t sleep through it. Firekeepers strike the fire for ceremonies, funerals, sweat lodges, and other cultural events where our prayers are carried by the smoke to Creator. A ceremonial fire is special; you don’t roast marshmallows or sing forty-niner songs at it. Firekeepers ensure that protocols are followed the entire time it burns: no politics, no drinking, and no gossip. Only good thoughts to feed the fire and carry our prayers.</p>
<p>Art must have struck the fire last night upon hearing the news. He will take care of the fire for the four nights and four days of Lily’s journey. At the end of the fourth day, as the fire goes out in this world, it is struck in the next world, where it will burn without end for Lily.</p>
<p>On the ferry ride to the island, I think about the second day of Lily’s spiritual journey. It is for atonement. She will face every living creature she ever harmed during her lifetime.</p>
<p>Time is a concept of our earthly minds. In the spirit world, his second day might last an eternity for him. As it should. My nails dig into my palms. I want Travis to suffer. To feel our pain. For his atonement to be a mirage just beyond his grasp.</p>
<p>I can’t be around the fire like this. Filled with such fury.</p>
<p>Only good thoughts for Lily.</p>
<p>I look down at my hands, expecting to see blood. The curved indentations resemble tiny scars.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-6" class="section level2">
<h2>12</h2>
<p>The third day is for Lily to learn about the next world. When I sit next to her casket, I keep going over everything I know about Jamie’s identity and the reason he’s here.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-7" class="section level2">
<h2>13</h2>
<p>After the prayer, she adds, “The burial at the cemetery on Sugar Island will take place immediately after the mass. The ferry tickets are covered. On behalf of Granny June and Maggie, I invite everyone to my home for supper after the burial.” Her voice cracks. “Everyone who loves Liliban is welcome.”</p>
<p>I choke up at the sound of Lily’s new name, indicating she is now in a different time and place. We traditionally add “-iban” after someone has changed worlds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ii-zhaawanong-south" class="section level1">
<h1>(II) Zhaawanong [South]</h1>
<p><strong>The journey continues into the Southern direction—a time for wandering and wondering.</strong></p>
<div id="section-8" class="section level2">
<h2>14</h2>
<p>This feels wrong. I’ve researched our medicines before, but for science projects like the chokecherry pudding. I wanted to show people that our traditional healers are—and always have been—scientists who use plants as medicine. But… this? Looking for traditional medicines to experiment with meth at the request of the FBI? It’s not right. In my heart, I know this.</p>
<p>“Giizhik is one of our traditional medicines. Cedar. One of the big four,” I say, deciding to volunteer information. “It’s a cleanser, a purifying medicine.”</p>
<p>“You put it in your shoes,” Jamie says. He doesn’t need to add at Lily’s <em>funeral</em>.</p>
<p>“You offer semaa, tobacco, to give thanks before you take any. Giizhik is protection. When you walk on cedar, you’re asking for help and goodness to surround you.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-9" class="section level2">
<h2>15</h2>
<p>I should have prayed this morning for manaadendamowin, since to act without harm is to know respect. There is power in what I am going through; it’s my responsibility to observe the protocols and protect others during this traditional grieving period.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-10" class="section level2">
<h2>16</h2>
<p>“I went to settle up for Binesikwe’s funeral and he said it was taken care of already.”</p>
<p>Hearing Lily’s Spirit name, I look down at my jeans.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-11" class="section level2">
<h2>18</h2>
<p><em>History and facts aren’t what matters. This is hurting my community</em>, I tell the robot.</p>
<p>Since I’m on my Moon, I don’t set down any semaa with my morning prayer. Women are at their most powerful during menstruation, connected to life-giving forces. Auntie gave me teachings: The reason we don’t use traditional medicines and we’re not around ceremonial fires during this time is that we carry our own medicine and fire within. Others may act as if it’s something annoying or unclean, but even the way we refer to menstruation is respectful. Auntie said, <em>None of this “being on the rag” or “the red curse.” Your Moon is a mighty time, Kwe.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-12" class="section level2">
<h2>19</h2>
<p>“Tell us a story, Firekeeper’s Daughter,” Levi says to me from across the fire.</p>
<p>I shake my head. “There’s no snow on the ground.”</p>
<p>Auntie says we honor our traditions when we save stories for the wintertime.</p>
<p>Macy scoffs. “That’s just so snakes don’t overhear the teachings.” She glances around. “All clear,” she says with a grin before launching into a story.</p>
<p>“Creator gathered all the animals and birds, along with First Man and First Woman.” She lowers her voice to sound like her dad, Chief Manitou. ” ‘I’m Creator and I’ve got a gift for each one of you.’ ”</p>
<p>People laugh.</p>
<p>“So Creator named a gift and waited for someone to claim it as theirs. ‘Who wants to fly higher than any other bird and bring prayers directly to me?’”</p>
<p>Macy waves a hand toward the sky.</p>
<p>“Migizi says, ‘Me. Me. Pick me.’</p>
<p>” ‘You got it!’ ”</p>
<p>Everyone laughs more. She waits a beat before continuing.</p>
<p>” ‘How about big teeth to cut down trees for a house that can purify a river?’ Amik nudges First Man, whispering, ‘You better not wait till the end and get stuck with a bad gift.’ Then Amik jumps up and shouts, ‘Creator, that gift sounds perfect. Please choose me.’</p>
<p>” ‘You got it!’ ”</p>
<p>Macy looks around the fire, pausing for dramatic effect just like her dad when he’s making a big speech.</p>
<p>“Now, First Man grew anxious as he watched the four-leggeds and the winged claim their gifts. He tried raising his hand a few times, but others were quicker. Finally, it was just First Man and First Woman left. Creator announced the next-to-the-last gift.</p>
<p>” ‘How about the ability to pee standing up?’ ”</p>
<p>The laughter is even louder.</p>
<p>“First Man pushes past First Woman. ‘Me. Creator. Me. Pick me.’</p>
<p>” ‘You got it!’ ”</p>
<p>Macy’s eyes glitter like the crackling embers at the base of the bonfire.</p>
<p>“First Man asks Creator, ‘Oh… by the way… what was the last gift?’</p>
<p>” ‘Multiple orgasms!’ ”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-13" class="section level2">

<p>Something black darts past. A raven, pausing to rest on a small boulder at the water’s edge beyond the pansies.</p>
<p>I recall Macy’s story at the bonfire. The way I heard the story from Gramma Pearl, Gaagaagi was away making mischief when Creator handed out gifts.</p>
<p><em>What will I do? Oh, why was I so naughty? How can I ever find my purpose?</em></p>
<p><em>Gaagaagi visited Makwa to see if he could learn her ways, but he grew bored. All she did was lumber through the woods finding medicines.</em></p>
<p><em>He flew away and observed each of his friends using their gifts. Again he scolded himself for being naughty and missing out on receiving his own gift.</em></p>
<p><em>One day as he was flying around, he heard Ajidamoo crying in a hole in an oak tree surrounded by the acorns he had collected.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the matter, Ajidamoo?</em></p>
<p><em>I am sad and I have no joy for anything I once loved doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe you should go see Makwa. She knows about medicines. Maybe there is a tea she can make for you. Come with me. I will take you there.</em></p>
<p><em>Gaagaagi led Ajidamoo to Makwa. Sure enough, Makwa had the right medicine for him.</em></p>
<p><em>A pleased feeling came over Gaagaagi as he flew away.</em></p>
<p><em>He kept going until he came upon Waabooz crying.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the matter, Waabooz?</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot relax as long as that sly Waagosh is trying to eat me.</em></p>
<p><em>But, Waabooz, Creator gifted you long ears and quick feet. You can hear things that others cannot. No one moves more quickly than you. You will have a head start on Waagosh if you honor your gifts.</em></p>
<p><em>That is true, said Waabooz. Miigwech, niijii.</em></p>
<p><em>As he flew away, Gaagaagi had that good feeling again. He had spent so much time flying around, watching his friends using their gifts, that he had come to know their strengths and how they might help one another in their time of need.</em></p>
<p><em>And that is how Gaagaagi discovered that his gift was in solving problems.</em></p>
<p>I am smiling when I approach the black bird on the small black boulder.</p>
<p>“And how will you help me, Gaagaagi?” I ask quietly.</p>
</div>

<p>“Herri… Herrington, actually. She’s named after NASA astronaut John Herrington, who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation and was the first Native American to walk in space.” I keep babbling, “Did you know that John Herrington brought an eagle feather to the International Space Station?”</p>
<p>“Paternity tests use any type of body fluid to extract DNA to compare the child to the father or his siblings. The Tribe requires a blood test. They were going to require hair instead, until some of the traditional pipe carriers reminded everyone about the violent history of our hair being taken from us… scalps that were cashed in like animal pelts, and boarding schools cutting children’s hair as soon as they were taken from their families. When Council debated using blood for the testing, that got heated too. Some said too much blood had been spilled already. But there were others who talked about blood memories. It wasn’t just generational trauma that got stored in our blood and passed along, but our resilience and language, too. So the Tribe voted for blood as the way to help children reestablish their blood connection. And for adults who got adopted out to find their way back to their family.”</p>

<p>When Lily and I were on Tribal Youth Council, we all played a game called Bigotry Bingo. When we heard a comment that fed into stereotypes, we’d call it out. Dream catchers were the free space. Too easy. There were so many others, though.</p>
<p><em>You don’t look Native.</em></p>
<p><em>Must be nice to get free college.</em></p>
<p><em>Can you give me an Indian name for my dog?</em></p>
<p>Maybe-Megan’s tattoo would have been good for another square: Native Americans as a sexual fetish. The more she talks, the more squares I mark on my imaginary bingo card with an imaginary dauber.</p>
<p>“I’m honoring Indians,” she says in response to my lingering scowl.</p>
<p>“Plus, I’m part Indian, so it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“My great-grandma was an Indian princess.”</p>
<p><em>Lily, we have a winner!</em></p>

<p>“Pretty soon the Little People were there. Smaller than me, but not young like me. The stories I heard about them weren’t nothing to be afraid of, hey. Little mischief makers, enjoying some shenanigans. Tying my mother’s laundry on the clothesline into knots. I always like a good shenanigan, so I followed them. Came to a boulder. One of them old grandfather rocks that have always been here. I was at the rock and then I was passing through it. Traveling on a stream beneath the island. Like a highway. Crisscrossing I don’t know where.”</p>
<p><em>Left your boots outside and now they’re by the outhouse? That’s the Little People.</em></p>
<p><em>Shoelaces tied in knots? Them Little People are playing a trick on ya.</em></p>
<p><em>Firewood scattered on the ground instead of stacked? Must’ve been the Little People.</em></p>
<p>“I had a cousin who used to sniff gasoline. We’d find him passed out next to the car. One time, he said the Little People yelled at him. But he kept on sniffing. I asked if they still came around to yell at him. He wasn’t always there, know what I mean.” Leonard Manitou taps the side of his head. “He told me, the last time they came ’round, they cried for him. He never saw them again.”</p>

<p>There is ceremony inside the madoodiswan. Healing. Returning to balance. <em>Madoodiswan</em> means “Mother Earth’s womb.” You enter your mother and leave reborn.</p>
<p>“Art heard them in the woods while we were in the madoodiswan,” Auntie says. “They check on us, like Animikiig during thunderstorms. Hoping to see us living Anishinaabe minobimaadiziwin.”</p>
<p>“And maybe getting angry if they see us messing with stuff we shouldn’t be around?” I hold my breath and watch Auntie’s face, all shadows and light from the glowing embers of the dying fire.</p>
<p>“I suppose so. But most who know about bad medicine aren’t going to leave it lying around unprotected. In the wrong hands, people can do harm by not knowing what they’re messing with.” She holds my gaze. “Those who know the old teachings, the medicines on the opposite side of healing, they respect its power.”</p>
<p>We sit in silence for a long time. Uncle David and Auntie used the term bad medicine. So had Lily… the day she went all goon on TJ after he dumped me. My uncle stated clearly in the notebook that there was no connection between the mushrooms and the bad medicine—his code for the meth-X. Auntie said bad medicines were the opposite of the healing kind.</p>
<p>As long as the FBI continues their wild goose chase in search of a hallucinogenic mushroom, they will leave our other medicines alone.</p>
<p>I release a pinch of semaa over the railing. It carries my prayer of thanks. <em>Miigwech for trusting me with the information about the mushroom. And chi miigwech for the responsibility of protecting my community by not sharing the information with the FBI.</em></p>

<p>“Pain?” Her surprise is genuine. “Daunis, you’re the greatest joy of my life.”</p>
<p>“But… I’m the reason your life is stuck in limbo now. If I hadn’t been born, maybe everything could’ve been different for you and Dad.”</p>
<p>Then I say the worst thing I’ve ever heard about myself. “I was the first of all the bad things for both of you.”</p>
<p>She looks at me in astonishment, until an epiphany flickers in her eyes. It lights up her face.</p>
<p>“Children are never to blame for their parents’ lives. Parents are the adults; we are the ones responsible for our choices and how we handle things.” She sits taller at the revelation. “If I’m in limbo, it’s because I chose to remain there. Even inaction is a powerful choice.”</p>
<p>Mom rises with an abundance of sight. Holds out her hand for me. I take it. She lifts me into a tight embrace that flows through me. Continues through the Earth’s crust and mantle, making its way to the solid inner core.</p>
