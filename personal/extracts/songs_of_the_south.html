<p>When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he grieved? He went into battle carrying his father’s corpse: why was he in such a hurry?<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> <em>When Wu set out to kill Yin</em>: The Han historians Si-ma Qian twice tells us that it was the wooden ‘spirit tablet’ of his dead father that King Wu carried into battle, but that is because he was trying to make sense of two irreconcilable traditions. The first time he asserts it, in his ‘Annals of the Royal House of Zhou’, he says that these events took place in King Wu’s eleventh year, i.e. eleven years after King Wen’s death; the second time, in the ‘Biography of Bo Yi’, he says that Bo Yi and his brother travelled to the Zhou court intending to offer their services to King Wen, but were shocked to find that King Wen had just died and that his son was preparing to lead an army against the Shang king. What shocked them was not merely that the new Zhou ruler was planning to lead an armed insurrection against his overlord, but that he was planning to do it <em>before his father was in his grave</em>. I suspect that in the original version of the story which Qu Yuan is here referring to it was a dead body, as in El Cid’s last battle, which led the troops to victory.</span></p>

<p>When the maiden warned the brothers not to pick ferns, how did the deer come to their aid? When they came north to the whirling water, why were they glad to be in that place?<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> <em>When the maiden warned the brothers</em>: this question is hopelessly out of place. The brothers Bo Yi and Shu Qi (see note on <em>ll.</em> 161-62) were princes of Gu-zhu who travelled to King Wen’s court having been told that he was a sage, only to find that King Wen was dead and his son, King Wu, was plotting rebellion against his overlord, the Shang king. King Wu listened politely to their remonstrations but refused to abandon his expedition, and the two brothers, rather than ‘eat the corn of Zhou’, retired to Shou-yang Mountain, where they lived on ferns. A woman suggested that even the wild herbs of the mountain were ‘corn of Zhou’, and the over-scrupulous brothers would have starved to death but for the miraculous appearance of a white doe which suckled them. All versions of this very popular story are agreed that they did eventually starve to death, so the diet of deer-milk can have been only a temporary alleviation. The question about the whirling water must refer to some episode in a version of the legend which has been lost.</span></p>

<h2>VIII <em>‘In Praise of the Orange-Tree’ (Ju song)</em></h2>
<p>The ‘orange-tree’ of this poem is the <em>citrus nobilis</em>, which was traditionally supposed not to grow naturally anywhere north of the River Yangtze. It is this ‘steadfastness’ which seems to have recommended it to the poet for comparison with the virtuous young man to whom this poem appears to be addressed. We can only guess whether this is a graceful tribute from an older to a younger poet or, as some have suggested, a poet’s tribute to a young prince of whom great things are expected. Some modern Chinese scholars have classified it as an ‘early work’ of Qu Yuan. The fact that it is written throughout in ‘7-plus’ metre makes this extremely unlikely; but what one believes about its authorship does not seem to me to affect in any way one’s enjoyment of this charming poem.</p>
<p>Fairest of all God’s trees, the orange came and settled here,</p>
<p>Commanded by him not to move, but only grow in the South Country.</p>
<p>Deep-rooted, firm and hard to shift: showing in this its singleness of purpose;</p>
<p>Its leaves of green and pure white blossoms delight the eye of the beholder,</p>
<p>And the thick branches and spines so sharp, and the fine round fruits,</p>
<p>Green ones with yellow intermingling to make a pattern of gleaming brightness,</p>
<p>Pure white beneath the rich-hued surface: a parable of virtuous living;</p>
<p>Its lusty growth to the gardener’s art respondent, producing beauty without blemish.</p>
<p>Oh, your young resolution has something different from the rest!</p>
<p>Alone and unmoving you stand: how can one not admire you?</p>
<p>Deep-rooted, hard to shift: truly you have no peer!</p>
<p>Alert to this world’s ways you hold your ground, unyielding against the vulgar tide.</p>
<p>You have sealed your heart; you guard yourself with care; have never fallen into error;</p>
<p>Holding a nature free from bias, impartial even as Heaven and Earth are.</p>
<p>I would fade as you fade with the passing years and ever be your friend.</p>
<p>Pure and apart and free from sin, and strong in the order of your ways:</p>
<p>Though young in years, fit to be a teacher of men;</p>
<p>In your acts like Bo Yi<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> <em>In your acts like Bo Yi</em>: elder of the two brothers who were so pure that they starved to death rather than ‘eat the corn of Zhou’, whom they regarded as usurpers. See note on ‘Heavenly Questions’, <em>ll.</em> 175-6</span>: I set you up as my model.</p>
