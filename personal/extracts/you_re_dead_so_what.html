<h3 class="subtitle">Media, Police, and the invisibility of Black Women as Victims of Homicide</h3>

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In a patriarchal (male-dominated) society, the lives of women have less value than those of men. The devaluing of women’s lives is even further compounded when one factors in race and social class. Black women not only face sexism as females, but they also are discriminated against on the basis of race and class. a number of black feminist scholars and writers have documented the historical pattern of white society rendering black women as invisible, particularly as it relates to their powerlessness as both women and minorities.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Amanda K. Sesko and Monica Biernat, “Prototypes of Race and Gender: the Invisibility of Black Women,” <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em> 46, no. 2 (2010): 356-60; Patricia Hill Collins, <em>Fighting Words: Black Women and the Search for Justice</em>, vol. 7 (Minneapolis: university of Minnesota Press, 1998); Signithia Fordham, “Those Loud Black Girls”: (Black) Women, Silence, and Gender ‘Passing’ in the Academy, <em>Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly</em> 24, no. 1 (1993): 3-32; Patricia Hill Collins, “the Social Construction of Invisibility: Black Women’s Poverty in Social Problems Discourse,” <em>Perspectives on Social Problems</em> 1 (1989): 77-93.</span> To suggest that all women are discriminated against equally is naive, to say the least, and virtually ignores the impact that race has in facilitating black women’s marginalization. As I have stated to my students many times in my lectures on racial discrimination, when people look at me, they see a “black woman”—not “woman black.” Race remains a powerful organizer of social life in the United States, but studies on race primarily concentrate on the experiences of black men.</p>
<p>The novelist and activist Alice Walker is one of several black feminists who promoted a separation of black feminism from the mainstream white feminist agenda, which they believed fell short in adequately addressing pivotal issues in black women’s lives.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> Alice Walker, <em>In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens: Womanist Prose</em> (San Diego, Calif.: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1983).</span> For example, african american women have experienced more disenfranchisement as females in a male-dominated society than their white counterparts because of race. this disparity impacts their life chances, their opportunities for social mobility, and, even more troubling, their crime victimization rate.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> Kimberle Crenshaw, “Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color,” <em>Stanford Law Review</em> 43, no. 6 (1991): 1241-99; William A.

Kovandzic, “the Impact of Women’s Status and Gender Inequality on Female Homicide Victimization rates: evidence from U.S. Counties,” <em>Feminist Criminology</em> 2, no. 1 (2007): 57-73.</span> Black women have lives that are “unique and significantly divergent” from those of white women, but most feminist perspectives do not consider that issues of race create a whole other level of complexity in black women’s struggles for autonomy.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> Ula Y.

Therefore a simple call for equal rights for women is, in short, useless for black women unless those rights also address racism.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hill-Collins argues that black women’s issues with violence are ignored when racial violence focuses on black men and gender violence focuses on white women. For instance, accounts of racial profiling and race-related assaults and/or homicides tend to highlight black men as victims, while stories of domestic/lethal intimate violence feature white women as primary victims. Therefore, race- or gender-only approaches eclipse black women’s experiences as victims of violence and are limited in explaining their unique position of vulnerability. Furthermore, these feelings of vulnerability are rooted in a historical context—namely, the inherent bias in the criminal justice system since courts routinely have been reluctant to prosecute rape and other crimes of sexual violence against black women, irrespective of the race of the accused.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> Patricia Hill Collins, “The Tie That Binds: Race, Gender and US Violence,” <em>Ethnic and Racial Studies</em> 21, no. 5 (1998): 917-38.</span> Ultimately, black women have long been disregarded as “legitimate” victims due in part to sexually deviant stereotypes.</p>
<p>Depictions of black women as hypersexual were seen as provocation for being victimized by rape or sexual abuse. the invisible or nonexistent status of black women has led to the view that the violence they suffer is “obscured, routinized, and thereby legitimated.”<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> Ibid., 926.</span> Scathing evidence of this attitude toward black women is evident in the Philadelphia police department’s failure to initiate investigations in more than 2,000 rape complaints from 1984 to 1997 because the police were skeptical of the victims and their moral character, especially when both the victim and assailant were African American.<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> Wayne a.

<p><strong>Black Women as homicide Victims: reality vs. Media representation</strong></p>
<p>So, what is the probable impact of crimes against black women being underrepresented in the media when the reality is that they are more likely to be victims of homicide than their white counterparts? unsurprisingly, it is a false sense of security in the face of very real and grave danger. Some black and Latina women living in New York City interviewed by researchers regarding the effects of media and images of crime victims indicated that they had less fear of crime because they falsely believed white women to be the more common victims of homicides based on the extensive and continuous media coverage of white female victims.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> Ted Chiricos, Sarah Eschholz, and Marc Gertz, “Crime, News and Fear of Crime: toward an Identification of Audience Effects,” <em>Social Problems</em> 44, no. 3 (1997): 342-45.</span> Further, they viewed white women as “ideal” victims who were submissive, weaker than ethnic women, and unable to protect themselves from crime. In essence, the media contributed to the perpetuation of viewing white women as primary victims, particularly in homicides perpetrated by strangers.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that regardless of declining national crime trends, the reality for minorities living in low socioeconomic communities is that violent death is an everyday occurrence whether the news outlets substantiate this or not. In fact, while researching literature on the topic of media coverage of crime and the general public’s view of crime victims, I was taken aback at the question posed in the abstract of one such article: “Why has the public persisted in believing that violent crime is a widespread national problem in the U.S. despite declining trends in crime and the fact that crime is concentrated in urban locations?” The implication of this question was not lost on me either as an African American or as a sociologist. It is clear that the “public” the author was referring to was middle class and white, since this group is less likely to live in an urban community, where occurrences of violent crime tend to outpace those on a national level. Therefore, the author suggests that this “public” should be less concerned about violent crime when it is not part of their community and thus is not their problem. this attitude forms the crux of this book, specifically that victimization of white females is seen by a biased media and public as representative of a threat to <em>all women</em>. But if violence happens to black females in urban communities, most white females need not fear for their own personal safety.</p>
<p>Given that violent crime is on the increase in urban and poor neighborhoods, it is both interesting and demoralizing that these statistical facts tend to be ignored by the mainstream media time and time again when it comes to crime victims of color. So common was the extensive media coverage of white female victims that a term was dubbed to label the phenomenon—“Missing White Girl Syndrome”<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> Sarah Stillman, “the Missing White Girl Syndrome: Disappeared Women and Media activism,” <em>Gender &amp; Development</em> 15, no. 3 (2007): 491-502.</span> —and numerous blogs and Internet websites have discussed the issue of disproportionate media coverage for these particular victims.<label for="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">11</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">11</span> Anderson Cooper 360° Blog, Wikipedia, Encyclopedia Dramatica, and Free thought Weekly Blog are among numerous Internet blogs that discuss biased media coverage of missing white females.</span> In contrast, despite the fact that African American females are 2.4 times more likely than white females to be victims of homicide, their deaths are not frequently reported in the press. In some cases, when the murder of inner-city women of color does get media attention, many reporters provide negative background details about the victim, implying that she was somehow culpable, particularly if there was a history of substance abuse, prostitution, or sexual promiscuity.<label for="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">12</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">12</span> A number of studies have examined the lack of vigilance on the part of law enforcement in investigating violent sexual crimes against minority women. These include S. Lamb, The Trouble with Blame: Victims, Perpetrators, and Responsibility (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1996); Janice DuMont, “The Role of ‘Real Rape’ and ‘Real Victim’ Stereotypes in the Police Reporting Practices of Sexually Assaulted Women,” <em>Violence against Women</em> 9, no. 4 (2003): 466; Jan Jordan, “Beyond Belief? Police, Rape and Women’s Credibility,” <em>Criminal Justice</em> 4, no. 1 (2004): 29-59; Phyllis a. Anastasio and Diana M. Costa, “Twice Hurt: How Newspaper Coverage May Reduce Empathy and Engender Blame for Female Victims of Crime,” <em>Sex Roles</em> 51 (2004): 9-10.</span> One can assume that even the suggestion of sexually liberal behavior can be enough to negatively shape the image of the victim in the public’s eye, especially if she is a minority.</p>

<p><strong>The Deserving vs. Undeserving Victim: Case Studies of Biased Media Reporting and Law Enforcement Intervention</strong></p>
<p>One unsettling reality about society’s view of crime victims is that there are times when victims are blamed for the violence committed against them. Perceptions of undeserving (the victim did not deserve or provoke his or her death) or deserving (the victim asked for it) victims of violence<label for="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">13</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">13</span> Isabel Correia, Jorge Vala, and Patricia Aguiar, “the effects of Belief in a Just World and Victim’s Innocence on Secondary Victimization, Judgements of Justice and Deservingness,” <em>Social Justice Research</em> 14, no. 3 (2001): 327-42.</span> are a consequence of the media constructing victim culpability in the manner in which they cover news stories.<label for="tufte-sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">14</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">14</span> Diane Richardson and Hazel May, “Deserving Victims? Sexual Status and the Social Construction of Violence,” <em>Sociological Review</em> 47, no. 2 (1999): 308-31.</span> In such cases, negative publicity about a crime victim may engender victim blame. the psychologist Melvin Lerner has argued that individuals who believe in a “just world” (or essentially that both bad and good things happen for a reason) may directly or indirectly attribute blame to crime victims if the framing of the story suggests the victim was culpable to some extent.<label for="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">15</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">15</span> Melvin J. Lerner, <em>Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion</em> (New York: Plenum, 1980).</span> For example, details about a rape victim being intoxicated or leaving a party at 2AM can lead some to believe the victim in some way deserved the assault. After all, a person might reason, “Why would a decent woman be out so late knowing that the world is a dangerous place?” The media have the power to counteract victim blaming in the manner that they “frame” the person. Isabel Correia and her colleagues examined “secondary victimization” and found that the assignment of positive characteristics to victims of violent crime increased the study participants’ tendency to empathize with the victims and to view them as undeserving of the violence they suffered.<label for="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">16</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">16</span> Correia, Vala, and Aguiar, “Effects of Belief in Just World.”</span> The authors describe secondary victimization as the process by which victims of violence experience feelings of being revictimized by negative or harsh judgmental attitudes from others. this type of victimization can also occur in the manner in which law enforcement officers handle sexual assault complaints from victims.<label for="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">17</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">17</span> Peter B. Kraska and Victor Kappeler, “To Serve and Pursue: Exploring Police Sexual Violence Against Women,” <em>Justice Quarterly</em> 12, no. 1 (1995): 86-111.</span></p>
<p>The statement “not that kind of girl” implies that Romona Moore’s moral character was called into question by investigators, and this unfortunately reflects a normative pattern of historical racial stereotypes about black female sexuality. the sociologist Rupe Simms used the term “Jezebel” to describe the century-old stereotype of black females as sexually promiscuous and insatiable in their quest to seduce men, thereby resolving the cognitive dissonance of white males who routinely raped black slave women with impunity.<label for="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">18</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-18" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">18</span> Rupe Simms, “Controlling Images and the Gender Construction of Enslaved African Women,” <em>Gender and Society</em> 15, no. 6 (2001): 879-97.</span> Furthermore, the promotion of the sexual stereotype of black women benefited the slave trade, as the proliferation of their reproduction was crucial to slave traders’ economic interests. Black women’s supposed voracious sexual appetites made it necessary that they not only “mate” with male slaves but also that their white masters were “duty bound” to impregnate them as well to increase their chattel.<label for="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">19</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-19" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">19</span> Ibid.</span> The political scientist and journalist Melissa Harris-Perry has noted that the historical view of black women as lewd and promiscuous denied them the right to be seen as legitimate victims of sexual assault. “under such conditions, black women—promiscuous by definition—found it nearly impossible to convince the legal establishment that men of any race should be prosecuted for sexually assaulting them. the rape of black women is simply no crime at all.”<label for="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">20</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-20" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">20</span> Melissa V. Harris-Perry, <em>Sister Citizen: Shame, Stereotypes, and Black Women in America</em> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2011).</span></p>
<p>The perpetuation of invisibility and the devaluing of these unfortunate black female homicide victims were not only carried out by the media and law enforcement. even the Greenville school district was negligent in issuing an alert to warn other students about Alicia Moore’s disappearance. When confronted by a local News 8 reporter and asked about the lack of warning to parents on the school’s website after alicia went missing, Greenville Independent School District (ISD) superintendent Donald Jeffries responded, “No, but I mean… so what?”<label for="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">21</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-21" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">21</span> Rebecca Lopez and Steve Stoler, “Reward Offered as Investigation into Greenville Girl’s Murder Continues,” www.wfaa.com.</span> Jeffries’s response of “so what?” encompasses the entire focus of this book. His obvious indifference to Alicia’s disappearance and murder is a reflection of the larger society’s disregard for vulnerable victims of color.</p>

<h1>Chapter 3.</h1>
<p><strong>An uneasy alliance: the Symbiotic relationship between the Media and Law enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Indisputably, when the media concentrate on particular issues, the public follows suit. The focus on blacks as criminals (particularly males) is very common. evening news programs are replete with minorities overrepresented as perpetrators of violent crime, but more rarely as victims.<label for="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">22</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">22</span> Richard J. Lundman, Olivia M. Douglass, and Jason Hanson, “News About Murder in the African-American Newspapers: Effects of Relative Frequency and Race and Gender Typifications,” <em>Sociological Quarterly</em> 45, no. 2 (2004): 249-72.</span> In particular, crimes involving white victims and black assailants receive the most extensive coverage. In doing so, the media are reinforcing long- standing stereotypes of black males as criminals and capitalizing on whites’ fears of victimization by minorities.<label for="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">23</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-23" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">23</span> Franklin D. Gilliam et al., “Crime in Black and White: the Violent, Scary World of Local News,” <em>Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics</em> 1, no. 3 (1996): 6-23.</span> Despite repeated denials by the media that race is a determinant in decisions regarding newsworthy coverage, research on this issue refutes their assertions. essentially, racial stereotypes perpetuated by repeated coverage of black males as criminals increase whites’ concerns about crime as well as support for more severe punishment for these offenders.<label for="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">24</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-24" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">24</span> Ibid.</span></p>
<p>Additionally, politicians (especially conservatives) exploit these fears and suggestively make white fear of black crime a platform for election. George h. Bush’s use of an african american murderer named Willie Horton during his 1988 presidential campaign against Michael Dukakis helped to catapult him into the White house as he ran on the platform of being tough on crime. Horton became a symbolic representation of the type of black male criminal whites feared most. The sociologist Richard Lundman points out that not all murders make the news, and of those that do, only particular murders become major news stories. Since local news stations are under pressure to bring in high ratings (which in turn increases advertisement dollars), stories most likely to receive prominent coverage are those that reflect the concerns of white society.<label for="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">25</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-25" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">25</span> Richard J. Lundman, “The Newsworthiness and Selection Bias in News About Murder: Comparative and Relative Effects of Novelty and Race and Gender Typifications on Newspaper Coverage of Homicide,” Sociological Forum 18, no. 3 (2003): 357-86.</span> this is not to suggest that most whites do not care about crimes that happen to victims of other races; however, people in general tend to identify with victims from similar social categories. Since whites are the dominant group in the United States, the media tend to placate this group in an effort to increase ratings and newspaper subscriptions. Both print and broadcast journalism are highly competitive in a race to provide breaking news coverage and garner a larger share of the market’s subscribers and viewers.<label for="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">26</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-26" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">26</span> Timothy B. Lee, “The Unprofitability of the News Business Is a Sign of Success, Not Failure,” <em>Washington Post</em>, September 26, 2013.</span></p>
<p>As several studies indicate, these crimes do not strike a chord of fear in the hearts of white Americans (since the victims are racially different), and therefore might be dismissed as a common occurrence and/or reflective of a minority group’s perceived cultural shortcomings. While searching Boston newspapers online for more information about a series of serial murders of black women that occurred in the city in the 1970s, I stumbled upon an article from the <em>New York Times</em> from the year 1971. The article, titled “Police Seek Clue to Stamford Murders,” covered the killings of five black women in Connecticut; their bodies were dumped in an affluent, mostly white area of the city. The reporter wrote: “the killing [referring to the last victim found, Alma Henry] seemed to have evoked interest but little fear and no panic among the residents of the predominantly white city of 108,000.” Several local residents were interviewed, and one man stated that if the killings had been similar to the Boston Strangler murders of the early 1960s, “everybody would have been scared… but don’t you see it’s not that type of killing.”<label for="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">27</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-27" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">27</span> Linda Greenhouse, “Police Seek Clue to Stamford Murders,” <em>The New York Times</em>, August 39, 1971. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: <em>The New York Times</em> (1851-2009)</span></p>
<p>Most of Albert DeSalvo’s (the accused killer in the Boston Strangler murders) victims were white females, with the exception of one black female, twenty-year-old Sophie Clark. The neighbor’s use of the term “everybody” seems to imply that whites are representative of most people, and because the Stamford killings were of black women, victims who also had a history of prostitution and drug use, their deaths were insignificant. Another resident, a married woman with children, expressed her concern about the homicides, but fear was not the basis. “We don’t like being made a dumping ground,” she said. “I just hope the next body doesn’t turn up on my stone fence or in the pool. It would scare the daylights out of my children.”<label for="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">28</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-28" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">28</span> Ibid.</span> Incredibly, this woman’s worry was not about the fact that a possible serial killer had been murdering victims of her sex. These victims were neither of her race nor her class, and therefore she did not believe her personal safety was in jeopardy. She simply didn’t want the bodies (like trash) dumped on her property where her children might find them; her attitude demonstrated a callous disregard for human beings who had been brutally murdered.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that the purpose of the book, again, is not to devalue the lives of white female victims to advance attention to women of color. It is simply to demonstrate that all women, regardless of race, should be afforded the indispensable “capital” of the media when they fall victim to lethal violence. When the media work in collaboration with members of law enforcement, victims and their families have a better chance of obtaining justice against the perpetrators of their untimely deaths.</p>

<h1>Chapter 4.</h1>
<p><strong>Looking at Media Bias in three Major City Newspapers: results of author’s research</strong></p>
<p>Photographs of the victim are powerful story framers for readers. In my analysis of the articles from all three newspapers, I found that there was a greater number of photos in news articles for white victims compared to black. overall, there were approximately 87 percent more photos in white victim stories in comparison to those stories about black females.</p>
<p>This difference was even greater in the Atlanta newspaper—the total number of articles on white female victims in the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> had on average 220 percent more photos compared to articles featuring black victims.</p>
<p>In the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the difference in word count between articles on black and white victims was 258 words versus 508 words, respectively.</p>
<p>In an effort to test whether some of the story framing indicators and word counts could be used to predict the race of the victim, I used a number of statistical methods that revealed that word count, marital status, and the location of the article within the newspaper accurately predicted the race of white victims in my research. The story framing characteristic that had the most impact on predicting the race of the victim was marital status. In other words, if the marital status of the victim was mentioned in an article, the victim was most likely to be white.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was more likely that a married victim’s story would be located in a more prominent section of the newspaper to be noticed by the reader. Is it possible that the bias was not racially based, but reflective of a victim’s marital status? To answer this question, I controlled for marital status and examined married victims across race and word count. The findings indicated that even when black victims were married, there was still bias toward white female victims: white female victims had, on average, 85 percent more words written about their deaths than black female victims. thus, marital status did not elevate black victims to newsworthy coverage</p>

<p><strong>Making the Invisible Visible: Minorities’ Efforts to obtain recognition for Forgotten Victims</strong></p>
<p>I am not certain that the tentative outcome of a trial is the primary reason why viewers tune in, as Moss suggested. I believe that the shocking nature of the crime and the trial’s presentation of gruesome and explicit details of a murder are also factors that impact ratings, especially when the public believes the victims deserve justice. Consider the Petit murders in Cheshire, Connecticut, in July 2007. the home invasion and murders of Dr. William Petit’s wife, Jennifer, and two daughters, hayley, seventeen, and Michaela, eleven, by two men who were arrested leaving the residence after setting fire to the victims’ bodies made the likelihood of conviction absolute, yet the trial was covered in great detail in both newspapers and television broadcasts. HBO even produced a documentary about the crime.<label for="tufte-sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">29</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-29" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">29</span> <em>The Cheshire Murders</em>, HBO film, 2013.</span></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As a black woman, let me say that I am not a ghost. I exist as all other living creatures do, yet I do not always see an accurate reflection of who I believe I am in popular culture and the media. When images of black females manifest, they do so in the form of stereotypes and caricatures— from the angry black woman to the single mother of multiple children dependent upon welfare. It is hardly surprising that black women fail to foster sympathy from the larger society when they fall victim to tragedy, and as many cases in this book demonstrated, they are often seen as being culpable in their victimization.</p>
<p>In a world where concepts of beauty are predicated upon the physical makeup of women, historically racist ideology demeans African American women’s distinct ethnic beauty, which has been virtually nonexistent in mainstream women’s magazines. For centuries, black women’s lips have been ridiculed as being too large, and their hips and derrieres were scourged as being abnormal and indicative of a primitive body type; yet today, some of the fastest growing cosmetic procedures are buttock implants, butt lifts, and injections. Despite the fact that black skin experiences a slower aging process due to melanin, few beauty magazines tout it as having inherent anti-aging properties. even the magazine Psychology Today published a racist and highly contested pseudoscientific study by Satoshi Kanazawa, a professor at the London School of economics who claimed that black women were less attractive compared to females of other races. he even suggested that african american women were less physically attractive than black men! Kanazawa based his findings on illogical, deliberately misinterpreted “data” and evolutionary measures of facial symmetry.<label for="tufte-sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">30</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-30" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">30</span> Hilary Moss, “Satoshi Kanazawa Causes Firestorm after Claiming Black Women Less Attractive,” <em>Huffington Post</em>, May 17, 2011.</span> there was a swift and angry outcry against the magazine, and the editor quickly offered an apology. However, the article managed to contribute to the reinforcement of white society’s discounting of black women’s physical beauty. Perhaps the dismissal of black women as desirable females in a racially prejudiced public contributes to their marginalized, invisible status in a white-dominated society. From slavery through contemporary times, African American women were not protected from violence or recognized as legitimate victims when violated.</p>
