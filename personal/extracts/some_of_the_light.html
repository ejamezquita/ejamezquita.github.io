<h2>Variation on <em>This Land</em></h2>
<p>This land is your land</p>
<p>this land is Comanche land,</p>
<p>Mescalero Apache land,</p>
<p>Coahuiltecan land, my ancestors—</p>
<p>bent to build the Alamo, then slaughtered</p>
<p>and buried beneath it, risen again, to be forgotten,</p>
<p>now a river to be walked upon, treaded by tourists,</p>
<p>on a mission, who find San Antonio a city</p>
<p>with two thighs, good only for entering and exiting.</p>
<p>This land is my grandfather’s land</p>
<p>whipped to suffer his color in the cumin air,</p>
<p>to erase that he ever loved, the way only a brown boy</p>
<p>can love Brownsville, beneath oil derricks</p>
<p>and sugarcane horizons, and fields</p>
<p>of afterthought, a cluster of cancerous</p>
<p>lovers in the wake of red dust, and pickup truck</p>
<p>envy, never again, this land, never—</p>
<p>This Land looks better in the rearview,</p>
<p>better under night’s speckled eye,</p>
<p>better in the black sputum</p>
<p>of its horny oceanic spills, better under</p>
<p>the fog of hurricanes, or the distant plano-myth</p>
<p>of its own romantic promise, this land</p>
<p>is your Matanza land, your prideful legacy</p>
<p>of mounted Rangers by dawn’s zealot light land,</p>
<p>mass unmarked graves, and tales of a nascent Amerika</p>
<p>on the come up, your Corpse of Christ land,</p>
<p>that tore the tongue from my grandmother’s</p>
<p>tender jaw, this is your inheritance, not the land</p>
<p>keep this land, bury yourself here, deep in the heart</p>
<p>of your taxidermied glory, of your nostalgic West,</p>
<p>no amount of sermons from your mega-preachers</p>
<p>can undo how vast hexes span.</p>

<h1>Natural Takeover of Small Things</h1>
<div id="my-name-is-hernandez" class="section level2">
<h2>My name is Hernandez</h2>
<p>It means descendant of Hernán Cortés.</p>
<p>Said, Spaniard who slayed Moctezuma and a nation of ore, occupied territories</p>
<p>known since as Southwest. Enslaved captives who stewed in marshes of mud and thicket, forced to shoulder slabs of obsidian,</p>
<p>tear tule from root, to shape</p>
<p>indestructible pylons of new empire rising—</p>
<p>Though I am not this dramatic by any means. I watch television in my boxer shorts, eat sardines from the can, breath on my children’s faces</p>
<p>just to watch them shriek.</p>
<p>My name is Hernandez. My father is a field worker. Every sugar beet you’ve ever eaten he’s shorn away what threatened to destroy it.</p>
<p>When I was born he wore me on his back while slouching over a short-handled hoe in the monsoon plains of five Wyoming summers.</p>
<p>There is too much time for memory to be accurate. My father’s worked since the day of his conception. A shoeshine boy in the parlors of south Texas.</p>
<p>The adobe tiles were relics from days of indentured servitude. Earthen red clay shingles the boy destroyed with rifle.</p>
<p>Mesquite is what he recalls mostly. And how the chicharra’s song is a quantum thread between this life</p>
<p>and that. I see him now, behind the wheel of a rig, hazardous materials, head a snow capped slab of insidious worry. Illuminated by the coo</p>
<p>of a grandson, the most fragile ammonite coiled in the shape of his own quavering hand.</p>
<p>My name is Hernandez. Born of a woman who was born of a woman… though I’ve said this once before. Don’t let her flexible disposition fool you. Consider the blade of a palm leaf, on Palm Sunday. Consider the Sabbath, Ash Wednesday. She is devoted to the countdown of years, starting from ten. Her time here is limited. Same is true for the rest of us. Except she has gotten good at forgetting this. We haven’t. We miss. She lets on a permanence, not seen since the resurrection.</p>
<p>My name is Hernandez. Of a Dinuba Sanitarium that crumbled in ’89.</p>
<p>Of an elementary school hidden between a plum orchard and the voluptuous golden thigh of a foothill. Of an education that included the neon powder of sulfur.</p>
<p>Of menial jobs—fast-food dives and an auto detailing stint Of thirty days in the Tulare County Jail, and then five more.</p>
<p>Of flea markets and strip malls. Of television ’round the clock. Of relationships to things and people that rarely go the distance</p>
<p>Of the punk rock eighties and pierced orifices Of the Dionysian Festival in the vagabond Corfu forest of ’92.</p>
<p>Of constantly risking solitude Of the grandfather on Magnolia Way, who pickles eggs in a tin shed behind a sulking house with two mortgages.</p>
<p>Of the twin abortions. Of regrets. Of saying things like regret because it’s expected.</p>
<p>Of reneging on words. Of doctoring the wounds with words. Of admitting he knows nothing of words.</p>
<p>Years ago, while living in South San Francisco, I walked into a carnicería with my last name emblazoned on the window. A young man draped in a blood apron greeted me.</p>
<p>I ordered three tacos de lengua, and smiling I told him that I was a Hernandez too. <em>Yes</em>, he replied.</p>
<p>Handing me the change. <em>Dicing the cow’s last word on the cutting block</em>, he said,</p>
<p><em>There are millions of us here</em>.</p>
<p>Millions of Hernandezes. Each one expecting some kind of deal.</p>

<h1>Skin Tax</h1>
<div id="mamas-boy" class="section level2">
<h2>Mama’s Boy</h2>
<p>They say I’m a Mama’s Boy like it’s a bad thing, when all along I thought that’s what a man was. They say my skin was made from goat’s milk &amp; dandelions and that my eyes were plucked from cherry blossom in the month of February</p>
<p>A Mama’s Boy they say, with hands too soft for picking legs thin as sprigs of mesquite They say my voice lacks the asphalt grit of courage, that I should work on it and that my name is too short to call me by name, and they’re right</p>
<p>When they say I was born with a hole in my heart the size of tiny fish eye. They’re right when they shout Mama’s Boy and poke at the tenderness that is my back claiming that my hair was quilted from a beggar’s scarf and that my smile was strewn from tender husks of sugarcane it’s true—</p>
<p>Since I’ve fondled and groped at the inside of my mama’s womb, just a squirming confirmation of father’s lust, I’ve scheming ways to retreat to that warm familiar sack of membrane and love manifold</p>
<p>This is why I lead with the docile nose of a house cat speak my intentions in raw doggerel utterances from the stiff core of a loose core of a taciturn tongue Why I tweeze the nose hair clean behind locked doors using the reflection off surgical steel buck-knives &amp; limp toilet handles lather my jaw with baking powder and lava rock skin tax for the morning peel Because I am soft, zephyr soft and teeming with secrets</p>
<p>I am the watermark of houses submerged My whimpering howl a rivulet of what remains from the hidden tidal tears of men Which is why they do not lie when they say my feeble knees are the silken steel edges of grandfather’s worn plow discs tease that my stomach is a sofa cushion stuffed with the down of a thousand geese and that my nipples are the fragile embroidery of Victorian gowns</p>
<p>My words, they say, these boyish longings, do not pounce from the gut like</p>
<p>alloy drum fire candy wine lingo</p>
<p>do not come on like</p>
<p>razor neck nicks splashed in allspice fire</p>
<p>will not crowbar the ribcage will not shoehorn the chunk boot or adorn the rearview in</p>
<p>deer hoof rabbit knuckle luck charms</p>
<p>Instead, they are made from sugar water &amp; pomegranate lust jelly for the dawn song warm rhythms for the doubtful eye &amp; the accusing heart</p>
<p>It is because of this, they jab their crooked fingers in my face and shout, <em>Mama’s Boy!</em> like it’s a bad thing when all along, you see, I thought that’s what a Man was.</p>
