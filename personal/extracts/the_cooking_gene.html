<h1>No More Whistling Walk for Me</h1>
<div id="morning-prayer" class="section level2">
<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>
<p>When I started going to plantations, you would often hear tour guides (sometimes dressed like Southern belles in hoopskirts, or as fifty-year-old Confederate soldiers sausaged into uniforms) and docents talk—actually they joke—about the “whistling walk”, a path, often covered, leading from the outdoor kitchen to the Big House, the plantation house. Supposedly this was the space where “the slaves” had to whistle as they brought the food in, to prove they were not eating. It was actually just an old architectural convention, though, that prevented rain and bird droppings from getting into the food, but the old white men cackle, the white ladies guffaw, and I feel my inner Nat Turner raging. They must giggle and grin because they think it’s quaint and tender as light biscuits to revisit in mind the Old South, where the pilfering nature of the tricky Negro was an accepted consequence of benign paternalism. In all of my days, I have been asked to prove everything I have ever said, but I have never heard a single one of these docents challenged for using racist folk history as fact. One day improvisation chased tradition, and I started to sing a new song as I worked: No more whistling walk for me / No more, no more / No more whistling walk for me / Many thousands gone.</p>

<h2>Still Life</h2>
<p>So much was lost—names, faces, ages, ethnic identities—that African Americans must do what no other ethnic group writ large must do: take a completely shattered vessel and piece it together, knowing that some pieces will never be recovered. This is not quite as harrowing or hopeless as it might sound. I liken it to the Japanese art of <em>kintsugi</em>, repairing broken vessels using gold. The scars of the object are not concealed, but highlighted and embraced, thus giving them their own dignity and power. The brokenness and its subsequent repair are a recognized part of the story of the journey of the vessel, not to be obscured, and change, transition, and transformation are seen as important as honoring the original structure and its traditional meaning and beauty.</p>
<p>The food is in many cases all we have, all we can go to in order to feel our way into our past. For others, we are an interesting note on the pages of a very different conversation. For African Americans and our allies, food is the gateway into larger conversations about individual and group survival. Ron Finley, an African American food activist from South Central LA, speaks of “drive-thrus killing more black people than drive-bys”. Vacant lots in Detroit and Milwaukee, Atlanta, Athens, and Baltimore are being turned into urban agriculture spaces in neighborhoods where fresh produce and jobs are scarce. While other communities might seem only passively interested in their histories, genes, and genealogies—the African American people struggle between nihilism, passing interest, activism, and obsession—and more often than not these are found not only within the same social circles or households, but within the minds and hearts of black individuals when they look at their relationship to their past.</p>

<h1>Mishpocheh</h1>
<p>I was addicted to obscure words and dictionaries so big you could use them to see over the wheel, and yet there were words that, had I known them, would have changed my life. <em>Familiensinn</em>: German, the feeling and sense of family connection. I longed for it I cultivated it despite the pain it has often caused me—family is not easy to seek or create. <em>Toska</em>: Russian. According to Nabokov’s translation of the Afro-Russian writer Alexander Pushkin’s <em>Eugene Onegin</em>, it is “a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause… a longing with nothing to long for.” <em>Fernweh</em>. Back to German, “a longing and homesickness for a place you have never been.” These words explain my childhood weirdness.</p>
<p>As the years went on, new people took the place of the first generation of cooking shows I religiously watched. Joan Nathan’s <em>Jewish Cooking in America</em> was in class two and I was hooked. More <em>fernweh</em>, more <em>toska</em>. New word: <em>Fressfrumkeit</em>. Yiddish: to be a dedicated Jew through greedily eating delicious Jewish food. Or to put it in a nicer way, to savor the taste of Jewish spirituality through its food. Old word: <em>Mishpachah/mishpocheh</em>. Hebrew/Yiddish: family, clan, tribe, a fellow Jew, a member of the tribe.</p>

<h1>Sweet Tooth</h1>
<p>Candy is the daughter of sugar. It all goes back to a man in New Guinea, or maybe it was a woman, since women were humanity’s earliest gardeners and some of its primary farmers. Someone was thirsty and cracked a piece of <em>Saccharum officinarum</em> open to slake their thirst, and they got more than they bargained for. It wasn’t just liquid. It was the rarest and most special taste in nature. It was quick energy. It was divine. Sugar became part of the genealogy of the tribes of New Guinea, and in one legend, a man having relations with sugarcane begat the rest of humanity. About ten thousand years ago, in some small, dark way, the discovery of humanity’s most treasured taste sowed the seeds for my American experience. Without the impulse to find new lands for which to expand the production of sugar, among other interests, there might not have been a transatlantic slave trade.</p>
<p>As sugar gained popularity, it was grown in the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt, bouncing from Cyprus to Crete, to Sicily, to the Iberian Peninsula, to the Canaries and Madeira, and later to the islands off the coast of Africa. Drawing on models left behind by the Roman <em>latifundia</em>, the idea and cultural presence of the plantation was born in the Mediterranean basin. These plantations were worked by a number of “slaves,” a word most people are familiar with that may be traced to the word “Slav,” of the ethnic-linguistic nations of eastern Europe. Slavs weren’t black, but the workers on these early sugar plantations were often a mixture of Slavs, Africans, Middle Easterners, and local peasants. Slavery did not yet have a racial context.</p>
<p>Sugar diffused among Africans as not much more than a snack plant. Meanwhile, the proliferation of beverages that demanded sugar, and the greater democratization of sugar’s availability, and its naturally addictive nature meant bad news for my ancestors and many, many more. According to some estimates, about 80 percent of all captives brought to the Americas were brought to regions where sugarcane was the main cash crop. No sugar, no slavery.</p>
<div id="the-caribbean-kiss" class="section level2">
<h2>The Caribbean Kiss</h2>
<p>By the time Solomon Northup found himself in the sugarcane fields, a new system of sugar manufacture and filtration had been developed by a mulatto named Norbert Rilleiux, the son of a white plantation owner and a free woman of color. Much like his contemporary Edmond Albius—a black man enslaved in the French colony of Mauritius who improved vanilla production by developing a method of hand pollination—or Antoine, the enslaved gardener at Louisiana’s famed Oak Alley plantation who successfully grafted and improved the cultivation of pecans, Norbert Rillieux is the household name that never was.</p>

<div id="the-other-cane" class="section level2">
<h2>The Other Cane</h2>
<p>Sorghum was an African grass cultivated for millennia, and its seeds and sweet stalk were being grown in mainland North America since the colonial period. Its cultivation was centered around the settlements of the enslaved in the form of “Guinea corn.” In the 1850s, experiments with several varieties led to the attempt to popularize sorghum as a cheaper and temperate alternative to sugarcane. While it did not produce a granulated sugar, sorghum did provide a molasses that was widely popular among Southern and Midwestern farmers because it was relatively easy to raise and produced a cheaper, homegrown alternative to sweeten coffee and baked goods, and could be used as a condiment at the table.</p>
<p>Long before coming to America, sorghum was used to make a taffy in the Sahel in West Africa. But some books today have even attributed sorghum to North American indigenes, and in the nineteenth century it was called “Chinese sugarcane.” Sorghum seems to always have had an American identity crisis. Whatever story you want to spin, sorghum is one of Africa’s more important contributions to plant domestication, and this should be recognized in an era when sorghum is now a hot commodity being marketed as the Southern answer to maple syrup. At least one variety has been traced to origins in southern Africa, a cultivar known as imphee grown in the Zulu empire.</p>

<h2>Sugar’s Revenge</h2>
<p>Some stories just need to be passed on. In 1865, my great-great-great-grandmother Rosetta Merritt, enslaved on the Chadwick plantation in Russell County, Alabama, got into a fight with the former overseer who thought he had it in him to overpower Rose and rape and beat her. According to oral history he pulled her into the cellar of the Big House where they wrestled until she got the best of him and dunked his head in a barrel of cane syrup made on the place. Because he was known to be often intoxicated, nobody questioned her when he was found drowned up past the neck. I told you that story just to honor my mother, who told me to retell the story in order to tell the world that her people fought back.</p>

<h1>Mothers of Slaves</h1>
<p>Go to Charleston and you will inevitably hear about Sullivan’s Island, a quiet spot outside the city that people wander through—but mostly for the views of the Atlantic, not knowing its role during the transatlantic slave trade. Historians have had a habit of calling it the “Ellis Island of African America.” Four of every ten Africans brought to what became the United States arrived here, a figure comparable with European arrival in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One group was of people exiled into chattel slavery, another was of willing newcomers from Europe. But that one word is all the difference and obviates the comparison: “willing”. These were not willing immigrants, and the very idea of Ellis Island—hope, chosen change, redemption, future, opportunity, and the like—was not found here.</p>
</div>
<div id="alma-mater" class="section level1">
<h1>Alma Mater</h1>
<p>It’s such a tiny thing, teosinte. The first time I saw a picture in a book of this wild Mexican grass with tiny, tender little green seeds, I really began to marvel at the ingenuity of humankind and our ability to turn the insignificant into a miracle. You might never have heard of it, but you know its descendant, and chances are, no matter where you live in the world, you’ve been touched by its presence. Just as people have genealogies, so do plants. Teosinte is one of the ancestral grasses of the corn/maize we know today, which was domesticated by indigenous Americans more than ten thousand years ago, and without it African cuisines and their descendant cuisines in the Americas would not be the same. Corn became our “other mother.”</p>
<p>Named maize after <em>mahiz</em>, a Taino/Arawak word, trade and migration spread corn out of the central valley of Mexico up into southern Canada and down into the kingdoms of the Andes and across South America. The natchez people of Mississippi and Louisiana, the saving remnant of the mound-builder civilization with their massive earthworks and trading networks across vast distances—which corn, in part, helped to expand—were said to have forty-two different recipes involving maize, from porridges and quick breads to whole ears or porridge cooked with fruit like Choctaw <em>walakshi</em>. The Natchez were the last gasp of this great corn-based culture, but it was the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, among many others, who rose as distinct peoples after the time of the Mound Builders, whos foodways would ensure that every Southerner went native.</p>
<hr />
<p>Corn is not just a food to those who grow it, any more than yams or rice or wheat are mere sustenance to cultures of which they have been a part for centuries. The Corn Mother is life itself. Food was often expressed not as a thing in these cultures but as a <em>memeber of your family.</em> Corn, like sugarcane in New Guinea, was built into a genealogy that went back to the beginning of time. Southeastern Native confederacies and paramount chiefdoms were built on the holy trinity of corn, beans, and squash, with memories growing dime of the days when wild goosefoots and amaranths were staples. Dozens of varieties of each crop, and with them pumpkins and sunflowers and a few handfuls of wild greens, made up the vegetable regimen of my distant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Native ancestors, cultivated in their summer gardens in the village compounds, newly joined by Africanized crops.</p>
<p>Corn came to Africa via the Portuguese, and black people made it part of their spiritual genealogies and comoslogies, including Yoruba myths of chickens pecking at corn and creating the universe by scratching out the continents. Its post-1492 spread across Africa was a watershed event, but it was not part of some grand Columbian “exchange” in which there was sharing of material culture for the benefit of the greater whole. Corn was not just going to revolutionize how Africa ate, but along with other crops, in particular cassava, it would become just the fuel needed to spur on the prolific population growth that would be ample fertilizer for the transatlantic slave trade. Africans were already familiar with sorghum, a grass family cousin, and apart from the end results, sorghum is similar to corn in mature form; it has a head of grain instead of ears. This visual similarity and corn’s taste and versatility, making everything from parched corn to corn porridges, breads and ferments, helped it become interchangeable with millet and sorghum in many traditional recipes.</p>
<p>Corn was not always immediately adopted by all African cultures that came into contact with it, and in some cases it was not adopted until the turn of the twentieth century. However, many of the societies that would eventually end up in North America did have some engagement with <em>Zea mays</em>. Olaudah Equiano left us one of the most complete descriptions of the transition from continental African to Atlantic African. He spoke of “vast quantities” of “Indian corn” growing near his village in what is now eastern Nigeria. To the west, along the Gold Coast, corn became <em>kenkey</em> and <em>dokono</em> and <em>akple</em>, a type of fermented corn dough steamed in banana or plantain leaves, eaten as an accompaniment with sauces and stews. The very root word for corn (<em>aburo</em>) in Akan languages shares with the deeper meaning of “white people” or “foreigners” (<em>obroni</em>) as something from overseas. All over Africa, it began to fulfill the same role as any other starch with which to make a relish or soup. In central and southeastern Africa, corn appeared as a thickened porridge that was eaten with foods that would later be found in the South—dried and salted fish, shrimp (think shrimp and grits), cassava leaves or wild greens, chicken, meat, pumpkin leaves, offal, buttermilk, and beans. Maize was eaten universally, roasted in the ashes of the fire or over a grill. Quick cornbreads emerged across Africa at various places and times, none particularly complicated and almost all mirroring the hardtacks of slavery to come.</p>

<h2>The voyage of no return</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At last, when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo, they made ready with many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck, so that we could not see how they managed the vessel. But this disappointment was the least of my sorrow. The stench of the hold while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it was dangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the whole ship’s cargo were confined together, it became absolutely pestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become insupportable; and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.</em></p>
<p>—Oludah Equiano, Enslaved Igbo runed abolitionist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The slave trade was timed to make deliveries of enslaved Africans in tune with the agricultural cycle, especially those of maize, rice, and yams. Stephen D. Behrendt’s work reearching seasonality and the slave trade makes a compelling argument for the connection between food and enslavement, referring to “slave supply and demand linked to the seasonal production of African staples and American cash crops.” Slave traders were essentially “shifting farmers between Atlantic agricultural systems.” Most enslaved Africans delivered to the Caribbean arrived during the winter months during the time of the cane planting. My ancestors arrived in North America during the height of the weeding and tending of crops—predominantly in the late spring through early fall, when they would be ready to go right into the field and could avoid the immediate shock of colder weather. For many, the waiting period between planting and weeding and harvesting a crop was the time of year they were hunted to feed the trade.</p>
<p>Once they arrived, corn greeted them again as they awaited sale, and in one form or another—from ashcake to hominy—probably was their first meal in the plantations of the Chesapeake and beyond. The crop they encountered the most on any given farm was corn—food for humans and livestock.</p>
<p>Corn played backup to rice in the Low Country and southern triangle of Louisian. Even in South Carolina, corn vied with rice as a staple, with one or both starches starring in every meal. In Louisiana corn preparations reflected the impact of both Senegal and Benin, where maize held its own. It became coush-coush in the hands of Senegalese women, who then passed it on to Acadians. In the rest of the South, a similar dish would be known as “kush.” Kush was stale cornbread cooked with grease, red pepper, and whatever else was on hand—a forerunner to Southern cornbread dressing. Most corn was not consumed in porridges and scrambles; instead most corn only knew second life as hoecake or ashcake or hominy, and because of the latter, the black population may have been spared from massive nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Hominy’s saving grace was nixtamalization—the chemical dehulling process conceived thousands of years ago in central Mexico, with variations through the cultures of the woodlands. Nixtamalization made corn a more readily digestible food, with more of the essential amino acid lysine, taking it from an empty carbohydrate to a complete food when eaten with beans and field peas as it often was. Although nixtamalization was found throughout the Americas, it did not transfer to Africa in the same way that detoxifying cassava crossed the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Corn was our other mother, and sometimes she committed infanticide. As slavery pulled to a close and sharecropping and the industrialization of food emerged, plain cornmeal and nixtamalized corn was consumed in greater quantities out of convenience. The big, pearly, puffy grains of hominy—pasty but filling and nutritious—gave way to corncakes and mush that were empty carbohydrates with little nutritional value. The descendants of the enslaved, caught in the system of debt and poverty, could afford little more than meat, meal, and molasses—the 3 Ms—and these often came from the plantation store, leading to more debt. On such poor diets, nutritional deficiencies abounded, especially the scourge of the South, pellagra, caused by a lack of niacin. Thousands of Southerners, depending on corn for their mainstay and little else, developed the disease, which caused itchy skin, senility, and bowel disturbances. Many Southerners died, including my great-great-grandmother, Hettie Esther Hughes, the midwife born into slavery, who lived to be ninety, but died because of a preventable nutritional deficiency founded in Mother Corn.</p>

<h1>The Queen</h1>
<p>Rice cultivation spread out from the ancient Sudanic kingdoms as my ancestors reinvented themselves, redrew linguistic and clan lines, and migrates from the empire of Old Mali and went out into the lands of the Bullom and others, coming as Mane conquerors displacing the indigenous people and planting up the rain forests and coastal swamps in African red rice, namely <em>Oryza glaberrima</em>. This three-thousand-year-old rice would in time be joined by Asian rice, <em>O.sativa</em>, from introductions made from both the Islamic and European worlds.</p>
<p>African red rice is a sacred plant to many of the people who still grow it. It is intimately associated with the ancestors; it was even used to start a revolution in colonial Senegal. According to my friend Senegalese chef Pierre Thiam, “a young, handicapped Jola woman named Aline Sitoe Diatta” had a vision during a drought from the Jola Supreme Being to return to the ancient rituals of their ancestors, and to abandon the broken Asian rice given to them by the French colonial authorities during World War II. It was not enough to grow and cultivate the rice; the Jola were to return to traditional forms of land management and respect for sacred woodlands. Aline Sitoe Diatta met her end in exile in Timbuktu, ultimately dying of starvation. Rice has a long history with culinary justice.</p>
<p>African rice was a part of the whole system of how social power, spirituality, sexuality, material craftsmanship, and culinary ability were expressed. Because of this, my ancestors from the Rice Coast developed rich and highly socially regulated cultures where agricultural knowledge, music and dance, and the art of the masquerade flourished for both men and women. Again we are in a world where a single food sets the blueprint for an entire civilization. Rice fed the ancestral dead; it was necessary for sacrifices to lesser deities; men sang of their prowess while preparing the fields; and women gave constructive criticism back as they pounded rice. It was the first and last solid food a person ingested from cradle to grave; rice was tied to the flow of the generations. To pound and cook rice was a skill central to everything they knew.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I taught at a local synagogue, one of my classes for tenth and eleventh graders, and innocently enough one of our conversations turned to the subject of race. I was the only African American in the room—the only person of color in the room, period—and the presiding adult. Not long into the conversation I got a slew of corrections:</p>
<p>“My teacher [at private school] told me blacks prefer to live in ghettos, so they just stick to their own kind and that’s why they don’t get ahead.”</p>
<p>“My ancestors came here and worked hard and people discriminated against them; I don’t understand why black people can’t get ahead.”</p>
<p>“Why are you even bringing up slavery? That happened a really long time ago. I mean you shouldn’t forget it, but it’s really not helping talking about it. In fact, we make racism worse by talking about it.”</p>
<p>I stumbled in my words. I could have given them a long history lesson but I couldn’t think of where to start. I also realized I was not arguing with high schoolers but with their parents. This is how their parents really felt about race in America, and I was profoundly discouraged. I wanted to leave the room and scream but I had no choice but to face the gauntlet. I tried to counter with the narrative of compulsory illiteracy, lynching, targeted redevelopment, redlining, and loss of culture and heritage, but I got choruses of “I don’t buy that,” and, “That’s bullshit.” Until Keith Doar piped in.</p>

<h1>Adam in the Garden</h1>
<p>If there was one thing my grandmothers agreed on, which wasn’t much, it was that they remembered the Depression as a time when even though their families had to make do with less, they were still not as bad off as some urban whites who got comfortable in their power. If there was one thing black elders across the South remembered from the 1930s, it was the sight of white men and women at their back doors looking for something to eat.</p>
<p>Their secret, of course, was the garden. Long before anyone heard of a “victory garden,” Africans in America, South and North, were no strangers to the truck patch or provision ground. In West Africa, it was often taken as a right that enslaved or indentured people would have their own ground to raise food for themselves. The wild nature of early slavery, where blacks in lean-tos and makeshift shelters had to create the infrastructure around themselves, lends credence to the idea that early enslaved people in Brazil, the West Indies, and the South were not only coerced to feed themselves, they understood it as a right. Even in federal and early antebellum America we have incidents of the enslaved insisting on ground for a patch.</p>
<div id="buck-swamp" class="section level2">
<h2>Buck Swamp</h2>
<p>“Food, racism, power, and justice are linked. What I’m trying to do is dismantle culinary nutritional imperialism and gastronomic white supremacy with one cup of <em>zobo</em> made from hibiscus, one bowl of millet salad with groundnuts and dark green vegetables, and one piece of <em>injera</em> at a time. The next wave of human rights abuse is in the form of nutrition injustice when we don’t have access, can’t afford and lack the education of our nutrition-rich heritage foods due to food gentrification, discrimination, Western food subsidies, and cultural food appropriation. Yes, Africa’s rich heritage foods were labeled once inferior and forbidding foods like her people. Change the plates, you change the palates, then you will change the future,” Tambra declares.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes and collard greens, turnip greens and fresh seafood, lean meats and healing spices have always been part of our tradition. Everything in our tradition is not fried. Some of soul food’s glories come from the freshness in the ground. Long before white America became health conscious, the enslaved had an idea that not all the master class ate was good for it. Frederick Douglass even noted that most of the gout and other conditions went to slaveholders, not to the enslaved. In communities where health disparities, lack of economic opportunity, and food deserts are rampant, we would do well to keep greening our neighborhoods and, as Tambra suggests, make our grandmothers’ gardens bloom again.</p>

<h2>Pork-uterie</h2>
<p>Italy may have its prosciutto, but the South will always have her country hams—first strictly of sweaty Tidewater summers, then later of crisp Kentucky and Tennessee falls. For generations the masters of these hams were enslaved men each said to possess a special savor to their particular “cure”. The recipe books of the turn of the twentieth century, like the <em>Blue Grass Cook Book</em>, assure that “Marcus” (that’s all he’s known as) knows the magic of how to preserve a genuine Kentucky ham. It even poses him doing the work of preparing them for the smoke. But nothing could compare with the skill and art of a black man charged with the art of barbecue. And nothing is today more controversial than identifying the roots of barbecue and what that means to the history of Southern food.</p>
<p>Cooking over sticks and saplings was known to both early indigenous Virginians as well as the indigenes of the West Indies, where the word <em>barbacoa</em> was supposedly encountered by the Spanish in the sixteenth century. The word “barbecue” also has roots in West Africa among the Hausa, who used the term <em>babbake</em> to describe a complex of words referring to grilling, toasting, building a large fire, singeing hair or feathers, and cooking food for a long period of time over an extravagant fire. In West Africa, unlike early America, the roasting of fowl, game, goats, and cattle in the savannah and Sahel was associated with celebrations, funerals, and the like. Animals might also be half-smoked en route from the bush to the homestead and rubbed with specific herbs and spices to ensure against spoilage or insect infestation. Absent from both West Africa and the domesticate that quickly became popular across Eurasia. The Eurasian tradition also drew on the practice of smoking meats. Barbecue coevolved in the New World, but certainly bears specific markers showing its West and central African roots.</p>
<p>Highly spicing meats; the roasting of whole goats; the use of peppery sauces or pepper vinegar; parboiling in some cases; the use of the wooden frill framework; the long and slow cooking process; sauces that utilized tomatoes, onions, peppers, and the like; and the social context of barbecue—as a tool to promote social conviviality and community—hearken back to the culture’s African roots. Even as barbecue certainly has roots among Native Americans and Europeans, it was enslaved Africans and their descendants who became heir to multiple traditions and, in turn, incorporated those traditions into a standard repertoire known as Southern barbecue. I recognize barbecue as a multicultural, coevolved culture rather than the sole product of any one of the individual ethnic blocks to which we owe its existence. However, we must cease efforts that would divorce barbecue from its African roots, connections, and narratives rooted in slavery and the African Diaspora.</p>
<p>The barbecue was always inherently political, as a “gift” to enslaved people that bought goodwill, discouraged resistance, and rewarded people pushed beyond their limits. An old, sick, injured or surplus animal (there may not have been enough grain or fodder to feed it) was culled and divided up. In this example, we barbecued spareribs, chines, tails, and other parts, and whole chickens, demonstrating the culinary divisions between the planter’s family and the enslaved. As a tool of political coercion, barbecues were used in early Southern culture to foment connections between planters and their families, and later became a critical ingredient in the performance of political rallies and the selling of candidates. Again, enslaved men were in many cases the early pitmasters, and their “wok presence” is felt both in the documentary evidence left to us as well as in the recollections and memories left by Southerners of generations ago, as well as those for whom this is a living memory. It is black men, not bubbas, who lurk silently and shadowlike in postcards and woodcuts depicting Southern barbecue. Their stories are mostly gone because they were just considered “the help.”</p>

<h1>The Devil’s Half Acre</h1>
<div id="hard-time-in-old-virginia" class="section level2">
<h2>Hard Time in Old Virginia</h2>
<p>Richmond’s Shockoe Bottom is a very old part of the city, dating back to the eighteenth century when the capital was moved from Williamsburg to Richmond. It was the crossroads of Richmond’s commerce, from tobacco warehouses to shipping and international trade, and finally the center of the Upper South slave trade. Its Victorian-style train station looms above the area where hotels and jails once furled bloodred flags announcing the sale of the enslaved. The area has come into the news for promises of development despite the efforts of activists to preserve the area and markers designating the positioning of the slave trade. There, not far from where the farmers market is today, public auctions were held and human beings sat in cages and in basements and backrooms, chained and awaiting sale. It is little wonder this section of Richmond was called the “Devil’s Half Acre,” where ten thousand people were sold per month during the 1850s. The irony of the farmers market being the site of the former slave auctions would be novel if it were not something I encountered again and again across the South, from Lexington, Kentucky, to Saint Augusting, Florida—the spot where healthy, local, organic food is now pushed once housed the “Cheapside Market” in Lexington, where slaveholders could literally get enslaved workers for a bargain.</p>

<p>I am still convinced cotton isi something only the Lord could have made. What good is its fiber to anything else in Creation, but humankind? While the oily seeds can be processed into an edible product for livestock, it’s not a plant that humans should eat, its lint being pure, indigestible cellulose—the crown of the “King.”</p>
<p>King Cotton’s sordid and greedy nature isi why I’ve confronted it over and over again, trying to understand exactly how a plant could so complicate American history and condemn America to an ongoing entanglement with the race question. More than that, the planters of this wonderfully inedible, beautiful plant—the snow of the Southern fall—were responsible for a dire change in eating habits among enslaved African Americans. Drawn from varied environs along the Southern coastline, my ancestors were packed into the landlocked Black Belt, where cotton prospered in a sea of malnutrition and fomented a monotonous diet befitting its permanent underclass. King Cotton had its own way of eating; and in contrast to the diversity of foodways from the mid-Atlantic to the Lower Mississippi Valley, the stars of King Cotton’s cuisine were maize and oversalted swine, swallowed down with rancid molasses and spoiled leftovers.</p>
<p>In the King’s grip, a killer diet was born.</p>

<p>I didn’t, however, come to learn just what it was like to pick cotton. I need to understand how an entire crop affected my family’s story and those of the majority of African Americans. Cotton would eventually come to shape an entire body of our food culture. To know why—and I could be in no better place to do it—I am on the land of the oldest working farm in America, definitely one of the first to use some of the “20 and odd Negroes” who first landed at Jamestown in 1619.</p>
<p>The comfort food of the Deep South, much of it influenced by the presence of enslaved cooks and enslaved people, is especially well known for its salt, sugar, and fat content. The molasses-born sweet tooth finds its way into damn near candied baked beans and collard greens here, and even into macaroni pie (the traditional Southern, and Caribbean, name of macaroni and cheese). Fat and fatback are amped up, and there never seems to be enough salt. If you live this way for a century and a half or so, what does it do to you?</p>
<p>Better question: Why do we eat this way at all?</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in picking cotton, which alone would make even Sisyphus throw in the towel. There’s nobody here—this is not a solitary activity. When I cook, I usually feel the spirits of people who prepared the same meals long past and I never really feel alone. This is different. My self-exile leaves me as singular as that stupid Zen tree we keep listening out for. I have wooden cups, a tin plate, well water, buttermilk, a “glug” of molasses, cornbread—correction, ashcake—and a piece of salted meat… the classic “plowman’s lunch” of the antebellum slave. I immediately feel connected to the past, but I’d much rather be back at the diner.</p>
<p>Into the earbuds pour folk music recordings from the chain gangs of Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana as recorded by Alan Lomanx, some of the most haunting music ever captured—and the closest we will ever get to the contours of slave work songs. Into that are other recordings of field hollers, right shouts, and call-and-response chants. Joined by a sonic gang, my work pace increases, my singing comes back into tune, and I’m wailing about the Grizzly Bear and singing for Berta to come back. My foot movements start to line up with a distinct drag, and basket after basket becomes full as I work-dance my way into the heart of America’s “original sin”.</p>
<p><em>Gossypium herbaceum</em> found its way into humanity from many directions—Asia, Africa, the Americas—and eventually found its way to Europe. Herodotus, the Greek “father of history,” gave the West notice of a plant with fleece surpassing that of sheep; an image followed up by Sir John Mandeville in 1350 of a plant both cute and terrifying—full of squirming tiny sheep begging to be pulled off their plant mother and culled to make a cloth fit for the gods. In West Africa, no such mystique existed, as cotton grew in many locales and was a long-established crop with which many ethnic groups had millenia of experience. In many cases, slave ships departed the West African coast with enslaved people and local cotton as cargo.</p>
<p><em>Gossypium herbaceum</em> is also, in part, the little plant with the beautiful lint flower that helped cause the continuation of slavery long past its seeming post-Revolution death throes, the Civil War, and between the two and beyond, decades of sociocultural evils for the African American culture and community. Eli Whitney wasn’t quite the genius he has been made out to be. Primitive rolling “gins” and combining methods were used in West Africa, and his “Yankee ingenuity” probably was married with a healthy dose of appropriation from similar technology he saw in use on a Georgia plantation in 1793. It is a mouse-crumb comfort that the man who spearheaded the American industrial revolution and gave it a raison d’être was himself ripped off to the point where he had no real control over his patent. By the time the first hand-cranked gin, capable of cleaning fifty pounds in a day versus only one pound by a skilled hand, made it on the scene, my ancestors’ fates were sealed… the money to be made outweighed the value of their freedom. Two-thirds of America’s nineteenth century export value came from the cotton <em>alone</em>.</p>
<p>The domestic slave trade was more than just the largest forced migration in American history; it was a turning point for the development of Southern food and in the way African Americans ate. For Chesapeake, Tidewater, and Low Country blacks, living on the coast near ports and between ecological zones afforded them an incredibly varied diet compared to the Cotton Belt. Not only were environments very different, but the mentality of King Cotton was far more industrial and dehumanizing. On many cotton plantations, time away from the monocrop was heavily regimented, and the gardens that seaboard slaves had depended on gave way to large communal gardens maintained for the enslaved population, usually by the elderly. The crops produced were fairly limited and monotonous: seasonably reliable, cheap to cultivate, and requiring minimal extra cultivation. Collard or turnip greens, sweet potatoes, and cowpeas were usually the lead items. Beyond that, red pepper, tomatoes, and okra might make an appearance, along with peanuts brought from the East.</p>
<p>Southern planters also became far more dictatorial about how and what their enslaved people ate. As far as the nineteenth-century planter was concerned, a peck of meal, a pound of bacon, and a pint of molasses was a sufficient weekly ration for a hardworking laborer. Gone were the days where corn was given unshelled for each family to process. Cotton had no time for that. “Jimmy crack corn and I don’t care,” as the slave folk/children’s song goes, “Old Massa gone away,” indeed. Stone hand-mills broke down the corn that was dispersed to workers in the field. The same hominy that had rescued their grandparents in the Upper South from the fate of other nutritionally deficient enslaved populations was no longer to be had. From pellagra to scurvy to iron deficiencies, the enslaved individual was the only type of person on American soil with a mandated diet that was just as much killing him as it was keeping him barely alive.</p>
<p>The flavors of the Southern frontier were largely shaped by the tastes and preferences of black cooks and black people, who in many areas of the Black Belt—named for its soil and its people—were the clear majority. For one example, during the Civil War, when the foods and luxuries of my planter ancestors were few and far between, it was the lowly, evasive cowpea brought from Africa in the seventeenth century that General Robert E. Lee praised as the “only unfailing friend the Confederacy ever had.” Elite and poor whites were exposed to the unique culinary perspective of the black majority—in slavery and in war—and would in turn pass these traditions down in their own families, further complicating the story of “who owns what” in Southern food. The contemporary reclamation of barbecue, offal, hoecakes, wild foods, black-eyed-pea cakes, and other plebeian fare by white chefs with the capital to promote and popularize these foods is one of the cornerstone issues of culinary justice.</p>
<p>In the black community, arguments and stigmas about soul food as slave food continue with us to this day. The Nation of Islam originally taught its followers to shun and avoid sweet potatoes, black-eyed peas, and collards, along with pork and the like, hence the popularity of white-bean pie in the Nation. Yet these would have been some of the healthiest foods enslaved people had access to at the time, although their preparation became increasingly enhanced by salty, sugary, and greasy flavors to make the monotonous diet more palatable.</p>
<p>If slavery had phased out around 1790 and gradual emancipation had spread, the whole history of America and her foodways would be markedly different. Instead, cotton ensured the growing and complete racialization of what it meant to be of African descent. African ethnic groups became the early Afro-Creole culture that began African America. If King Cotton had never reigned, we African Americans might be like any other ethnic group—stories might be passed down; names remembered; songs, words, religions, prayers, perhaps, even one might say, a sense of pride. Instead, names were changed again and again and again, as people were sold, further commoditized, dehumanized, and abused. Understandings forged between African and European cultures over centuries were dismantled, and the industrial spirit in the hands of those early African Americans was crushed for the sake of compliance and submission.</p>
<p>The disruption of the black family, the interruption of an important community-driven ethnic economy, then engendering of a poor diet, an urgent desire to suppress learning and education, and a culture of unrelenting violence—these and all the dependency, instability, and toxic thinking that went along with them were the fruits of King Cotton, none of which black America has been able to fully purge from its system.</p>

<p>Humongous yellow and crimson watermelons got broken and distributed. I still didn’t like watermelon so I gave my hunks of heart to Jacob, who ate them as fast as I could pass them.

<p>Make no mistake, I am now even more defiantly African American than ever before, and I am black, but I am not just black. If I was, I could not adequately tell the stories locked in my body or cook the food that connects to them. In American culture, black is too often viewed as a bubble in which individuality and variation are often seen as destructive to the integrity of the whole structure; we depend on these essences, we depend on these stereotypes for immutable, ready, off-the-shelf ideas about what it means to be a person of African descent in America. This has made it easy to disregard and smudge the names and identities of the cooks and the eaters who came before us, and to mute the music of the tradition they passed down to us.</p>
<p>The real history is not in the food, it’s in the people. We are working against the loss of our cultural memory; against the consequences of institutional oppression; against indiscriminate and flagrant appropriation; and against courts of public opinion that question our authenticity, maturity, and motives in the revolutionary act of clarifying and owning our past. It is my belief that the very reason we are here in space and time is deliberately connected to our journey with food. The only question I’ve ever wanted to answer for myself was, How was my destiny shaped by the history of Southern food?</p>
<div id="reeducation" class="section level2">
<h2>Reeducation</h2>
<p>African cuisine is still a cuisine of immigrant communities and some have speculated that it has had a failure to launch. My own feelings are that it hasn’t had a white savior yet, a translator. My friend Tunde Wey is owning the preparation of Nigerian foods and conducting dinners like my own that discuss race in America. But we both wonder if African cuisine is not lying in wait for someone white whom a “mainstream” audience will trust to lead them, just as the African role in Southern cuisine had its translators. Tunde’s response to the issue of racial politics and Southern food in his <em>Oxford American</em> piece with John T. Edge, director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, mirrors my own sentiments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White privilege is an obscene thing. It takes everything, quietly, until there is only silence left. Then it takes that too and fills it with noise. Southern food culture—which, to its corrupted credit, is more honest that “Northern” food culture, the perfect lens through which to observe this phenomenon. Southern food culture has openly appropriated black food culture and then prescribed the proper feelings the appropriated should possess regarding their hurt. Through kind concern, dispassionate reportage, and open quarrel, this privilege invalidates black folks by suggesting their experiences of prejudice are nothing more that overactive and hypersensitive imaginations at work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Culinary appropriation is about as dirty a phrase to those cynical about so-called identity politics as “reverse racism” is to the progressive- and racial/social justice-oriented. My own displeasure over the crowning of Chef Sean Brock as (African-influenced) Southern food’s savior has nothing to do with Sean as a person. Sean and I spoke by phone and broke the silence. I admire Sean and know he is my cousin rather than my combatant. He says he agrees with my main point and is wary of how he and his work are portrayed in the media. I take him at his word, but I still wince at a food media that has asked me more than once in the past, “What do you know that Sean Brock doesn’t?” It’s complicated by the fact that Sean was touted as culinary Dr. Livingston in an article on Mediaite.com, “Sean Brock Finds the Origins of Southern Cuisine in Africa”.</p>
<p>It is also clear that structural racism is beating back the black chef. It started with segregation; black chefs in the South were either poorly paid shadow figures (often women) working for all-white establishments, or were locked into their own neighborhoods in Jim Crow. Nashville Hot Chicken wasn’t a pan-Nashville dish; it was locked behind the walls of racial separation. Now gentrification, denial of loans to open brick-and-mortar restaurants, and lack of community support are the demons—economic stability utilizing our cultural capital is at stake.</p>
<p>That’s my very polite way of saying ongoing racial tensions in reaction to flashpoints and indignities may make white people nervous and uneasy or even annoyed, much as the fantasies of revolt and revenge did centuries ago, but this is not about proving to white people that black people are “cool”, in the sense of being long-sufferingly patient or interesting and trendy. This is about food being a tool for repair within the walls of black identities. When you are oppressed, how you survive your oppression is your greatest form of cultural capital. In the case of black people worldwide, the cross-pollination of African cuisines and the exchange of knowledge among cousins, this capital is limitless.</p>
