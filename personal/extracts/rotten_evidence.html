<div id="beginnings" class="section level1">
<h1>Beginnings</h1>
<p>I never tried to change society, except for a brief period as a child when I dreamed I was the long-awaited Messiah—which I later found out was a fairly common fantasy among Muslim children. I never had an all-encompassing vision of life, or of anything that might qualify me to teach or guide others, or even to really annoy them. I wrote a novel about my own sense of alienation; about the friends I loved, the ones that didn’t love me back, ant the ones that loved me even though I didn’t think I deserved all that love; about the city that swallowed up my best years and turned me into an arrogant, ignorant prick. I never took part in any political struggles. It wasn’t the Muslim Brotherhood or the Salafists or some religious fundamentalist movement that took me to court and accused me of offending public morality: it was an educated citizen and a lawyer, no less, in concert with another, even less significant citizen who happened to be a journalist. And it was the public prosecution office, a bastion of the justice system, that enthusiastically took up the case against me and appealed when the court of first instance found me innocent. The party whose morality was offended was the very authority that claimed to be secular. They wielded the fires of hell in one hand and the torch of enlightenment in the other.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-books" class="section level1">
<h1>No Books</h1>
<p>I spent the night engrossed in the former First Lady’s autobiography, reading about her kind heart, her brilliant intelligence, her struggle to gain an education, her efforts to cultivate her husband by inviting intellectuals and writers to lunches and Ramada breakfasts, her charitable works, her tireless efforts on behalf of war victims, her role in changing the country’s personal status laws, and her distress at the unfair aspersions and baseless accusations that were regularly cast against her. It was a good book for a first night in prison—full of lies, exaggerations, gossip, and name/dropping about her warm relations with various heads of state and their wives, from Shaykha Fatima of the United Arab Emirates to Colonel’s Gadhafi’s wife—and sometime around dawn, I finally drifted into sleep.</p>
</div>
<div id="free-provocation" class="section level1">
<h1>Free Provocation</h1>
<p>Despite Egypt’s rapid growth in population, which has just crossed the hundred million mark, the ability of its inhabitants to distinguish humans from animals appears to be decreasing. Anyone or anything free that refuses to assimilate into the general national lunacy is seen as being provocative. For the state, that makes you a dangerous saboteur; for society, it makes you an attention-seeker who’s mildly entertaining at best.</p>
</div>
<div id="laughter-and-rage" class="section level1">
<h1>Laughter and Rage</h1>
<p>That paragraph was my favorite, because it revealed what my real crime was, in the judge’s view. It wasn’t anything to do with “offensive expressions” or depicting a man and woman wallowing in vice. My real transgression was to have deliberately ignored the values and mores of Egyptian society—which I freely admit I’ve always hated and despised. I had taken every available opportunity to spit on its values and piss on its mores, and I’d shit on the whole damn thing if I could. And I was happy to say that my writing certainly didn’t aim to elevate the nation or foster morals and manners. I wanted to encourage people to take a good look at this thing we called a nation, to thing long and hard about it, and if that meant they might want to run as far away from it as they could, or burn it to the ground, then so be it. I didn’t have anything to offer to society, I just found that writing was a way of knowing and understanding myself—and a way of getting to know you, whoever you are, you who are reading this now. I found my voice through writing and through your reading, and in the words we shared, I found a meaning to life that seemed bigger than the nation-state, with its flag and its anthem and its army and its museums and its schools and its national literatures, which was supposed to drag people up to some purported cosmic standard of good manners and morals.</p>
<p>I definitely wasn’t the “tongue of society,” and I didn’t want to “earn its acceptance.” In fact, I couldn’t see how a writer could “truthfully express” anything and still hope to earn social acceptance. Can society ever bear to hear the truth, as Taha Hussein asked seventy years ago? And, anyway, when did this society of ours ever get together and agree on anything? How could one book earn everybody’s approval, when we were a society of two religions, each of which had its own book? And, most important, why would I want to be the tongue of society, when everyone else in society had their own tongue—and if I were to be the tongue of society, then what about my own tongue?</p>
</div>
<div id="wheres-the-evidence" class="section level1">
<h1>Where’s the Evidence</h1>
<p>The court was all-powerful, and nobody in the country had any right to object to its rulings. But it still couldn’t mention those unmentionable words I’d written; somehow, they overpowered the court, splattering muck on its robes and poking fun at its sacrosanct authority. There were words that the highest power in the land didn’t dare to utter, or even to list as criminal—secret, terrible words that let people’s lips only in times of anger, or when fucking, or joking, or fighting. And the thing is, when it came down to it, the court ruling was irrelevant. There were no angry expressions. I was a writer. Why would I ever give up such a terrific, untouchable power, capable of destroying society and its values? Why would I stop playing with such a magnificent toy?</p>
</div>
<div id="obscenity" class="section level1">
<h1>Obscenity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I do not think that obscenity necessarily should be limited to exciting sexual feelings. I can understand people reading something that does not excite them in such a manner but which they might still pass on as being obscene. I should say a thing is obscene by the ordinary language used and by what it does to the average reader. It needs to necessarily be what the author intended. On these grounds, I think there are ample reasons to consider</em> Ulysses <em>to be an obscene book.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Assistant District Attorney Samuel Coleman, from then case to ban James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, 1933</p>
