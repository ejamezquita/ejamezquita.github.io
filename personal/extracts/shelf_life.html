<h1>The Café</h1>
<p>“This is my daily outing. I absolutely love Diwan,” saide one of the café regulars with rabid enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“You must be a voracious reader,” Nihal said admiringly.</p>
<p>“I come for the carrot cake.”</p>
<p>“Good for you!” Nihal was relentless in her optimism.</p>

<div id="egypt-essentials" class="section level1">
<h1>Egypt Essentials</h1>
<p>My reliance upon a Frenchman to elucidate my own history underlines an uncomfortable fact: with some exceptions, Egyptians seldom write novels set in ancient Egypt. There’s a double irony in the way that colonialism first severs us from our past and then forces us to turn to the colonizers for knowledge of that very past. Westerners created Egyptology, then taught it to the Egyptians. It’s like the Antiquities Service, a government program started in mid-nineteenth century Egypt ostensibly to control the trade of Egyptian artifacts. It actually acted as an extension of neocolonialism: the program was headed by French scholars, and most Egyptian archaeologists weren’t even granted permission to excavate in their own country. An Egyptian wasn’t appointed to run the program until the 1950s. As an adult, I finally saw the bust of Nefertiti—at the Neues Museum in Berlin. The British Museum has the Rosetta Stone (and over fifty thousand other ancient Egyptian objects, making it the largest collection outside of Egypt) and still refuses to repatriate it. Bastards.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I wonder how our reliance on imported knowledge limits our ability to imagine. Are colonized cultures so accustomed to being othered that we unquestioningly accept that knowledge as a gift, never thinking of veracity or reciprocity? Eastern writers don’t narrate Western experience. Who owns the past: the creators of its narratives, or their consumers? Is it writers or readers who are responsible for filling in the gaps left by colonial estrangement?</p>
<hr />
<p>He looked around, his eyes landing on a nearby table of new releases, including Alaa Al-Aswany’s collection of Arabic short stories <em>Friendly Fire</em>. Its prominent cover, depicting a row of ancient Egyptian figures facing a can of Flit insecticide, elicited Dr. Medhat’s less friendly fire. “What impudence! How dare he insult our glorious past? Our fall from grandeur to decadence, c’est trop!” He paced around the table, flustered.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Dr. Aswany means any harm. He’s merely suggesting that we stop basking in our glorious past and focus on improving our present. We’ve become victims of our pyramid schemes: we swallow the feel-good pill of ‘we built the pyramids’ while our house crumbles around us.” I flashed him my most engaging grin. My father taught me that I could get away with saying anything to anyone, as long as I did it with a smile. “Is it acceptable that the descendants of the people who built the pyramids are now living in redbrick monstrosities?”</p>
<hr />
<p>Egypt Essentials was a small section that posed a series of questions without claiming to answer them. Searching for something, I gathered images of my home in one place. Our eclectic collection introduced the colonizer to the colonized, the historians to the novelists, the locals to the outsiders. Competing realities existed side by side in competing Egypts—extreme conservatism and a liberalism devoid of roots, offensive poverty and even more offensive wealth. They always have, and they always will. In my memories, as in Cairo’s streets, the present never fully overthrows the past, nor do the two coalesce. Like bickering neighbors, they delight in existing side by side in joint discord.</p>

<h1>Cookery</h1>
<p>President Mubarak was proud that under his governance, Egypt was a country free from censorship. This meant that we were permitted to speak or act as we chose, provided it was within the law. As law-abiding citizens, we knew that it was illegal to say, write, or print anything that offended public morals, threatened national unity or the social order, or tarnished Egypt’s reputation in the foreign press. Violating these rules could result in imprisonment, payments of fines, or the suspension of licenses. Mubarak ran our lives, and our homeland, under the guidance of a tried-and-tested Egyptian proverb: strike at the shackled and the free shall be deterred.</p>
<hr />
<p>If buildings hold memories, I hoped Mogamma’ al Tahrir had lost its. Occupying the site left by the demolition of the British barracks in 1945, the concrete leviathan was meant to serve as a centralized administrative complex where citizens could efficiently complete all bureaucratic matters. Its 1,309 rooms served more than twenty thousand people every day. It was a building only architects could admire, an icon of monotony and the death of individuality. (The Mogamma’ was actually the color of sand, but I remember it monochrome gray.) Kafka writes: “Every revolution evaporates and leaves behind only the slime of a new bureaucracy.”</p>
</div>
<div id="business-and-management" class="section level1">
<h1>Business and Management</h1>
<p>Over time I noticed a strange discrepancy. People bought business hardcovers. In our other sections, hardcover sales were confined to the likes of J.K. Rowling and Dan Brown. Unlike Americans, Egyptians seldom bought hardcovers—ours was, and is, a price-sensitive market. Most of the population could barely afford to buy paperbacks. Most Egyptians struggled to afford food, clothing, housing, education, and health care. If there was anything left over, it wouldn’t be spent on books. And the economy was still recovering from 2003, when the central bank “floated” the Egyptian pound, releasing it from the established exchange rate with the dollar and allowing it to fall in value. A popular saying summed up the situation: the eye desires what the hand cannot grasp. So even fewer people were buying pricey hardcovers, except for business books. I wondered why. Were these tomes essential office décor? Did businessmen display them like framed college degrees, imbuing their enterprises with an aura of success and scholarship? Was there an underlying assumption that businessmen could afford to spend money on books?</p>
<p>I walked to Hind’s side of the Heliopolis store for answers. Her Arabic business section was stacked with translations of my English-language bestsellers. Arab authors writing about business were curiously absent.</p>
<p>“Where are the Arab authors who write about business?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t any.”</p>
<p>“Don’t customers ask for local authors?”</p>
<p>“No. They want the foreigners.” Amir’s gaze narrowed as he mused, “I don’t think they would trust the advice of a local. They want the Americans who made it big.” The customers’ skepticism was well-founded. Nasser’s reforms had sequestered businesses, promising collective ownership with the people. Once-thriving enterprises became inefficient bureaucracies saddled with people who felt little agency, or ownership, over them. After his election in 1970, Sadat, attempting to salvage the failing economy, instituted Infitah, literally “openness,” an open-door policy that appealed to private (mostly foreign) investors. Mubarak, the next president, began a privatization program further aimed at divesting state ownership from the many businesses that had diminished in value due to poor management and corruption.</p>
<p>“Hard work won’t get you anywhere, but bribery will. We’ve learned to be suspicious of businessmen, because we see them as fat cats who amassed their wealth through dishonesty. Success is not something we celebrate. We envy it, but we know it was gained unethically.” He paused, as if answering a question. “Pray that Diwan coasts along. Don’t wish for it to become too successful.” His words echoed my father’s repeated warning: “In this life, keep your head down and hope nobody notices you.”</p>
<hr />
<p>As I read, I encountered my nonexistence. The books were oblivious to my cultural context; people like me had gotten lost in translation. None of these authors provided strategies for navigating Egyptian bureaucracy. Standardized guidance, like budget advice, failed to accommodate the idiosyncratic nightmare of creating systems from scratch (like ISBNs and sales figures), surrounded by chaos. What piece of advice could help me deal with the fact that every shipment that entered Cairo Airport took anywhere from one week to three months to clear, depending on the tangle of regulations, missing paperwork, capacity, and staff? How could I ensure stability when everything that should have been a fixed cost was a floating variable? How could I handle a workforce that would rather be employed by the government, a boss that would pay less but also demand less? Or customers who expected Diwan to be a library, and tried to return books after reading them? Practical tools were useless in an impractical landscape that seemed to follow only one rule: <em>insha’allah, borka, maalesh</em>. The words play on bureaucratic responses to requests: if God wills it, tomorrow, never mind. And then there was the added dimension of gender. These male authors, businessmen, and entrepreneurs came into this world never questioning that it belonged to them, whereas even in my own shop, I sometimes felt out of place.</p>
<hr />
<p>Men and their female bosses—sigh! As recently as the mid-1950s, when tensions ran high between Britain and Egypt during the Suez crisis, Nasser, in one of his infamous televised speeches, urged the British to mind their manners. A BBC program that referred to him as a dog had provoked his anger. His response? He reminded the British of the days when graffiti adorning the walls of Cairo and Port Said insulted them and struck at the core of their empire. The graffiti, which incited British outrage at the time, simply stated, “Your king is a woman.” Sixty-five years later, this comment remains an effective taunt among Egyptian men. Sixty-five years later, the male imagination still cannot fathom a woman in charge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Of course, these rules apply to women, too. While the scarcity mindset encourages competition, it also stifles solidarity. Life had confirmed Virigina Woolf’s claim: “Women are hard on women. Wome dislike women.” Even though this happened more than ten years ago, I can’t rinse it out of my memory. A well-put-together middle-aged lady came up to me on Heliopolis’s shop floor as I was stacking books and arranging displays.</p>
<p>“I want to speak to the owner.”</p>
<p>“I am one of them,” I said, as I set down the batch of books in my hand on a nearby table.</p>
<p>“You must be the secretary,” she scoffed. “Now run along and find me a decision maker.”</p>
</div>
<div id="pregnancy-and-parenting" class="section level1">
<h1>Pregnancy and Parenting</h1>
<p>“What about Dad?” I asked her once, in earnest.</p>
<p>“Ramzi?” my mother replied, now herself surprised. “Pregnancy isn’t a man’s concern.” But of course this has changed. As I researched books to include in our Pregnancy and Parenting section, I kept seeing titles geared toward men. Titles like <em>From Dude to Dad: The Only Guide a Dude Needs to Become a Dad</em> emphasized the transformation inherent in “becoming” a father (the implied transition from “cool” to “less cool”—from “dude” to “dad”—was not lost on me.) Other titles promised survival and salvation, like <em>The Expectant Dad’s Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know</em> and <em>Diaper Dude: The Ultimate Dad’s Guide to Surviving the First Two Years</em>. The motif of the diaper (absent from titles geared at women), and the dude who wields it, attempted to infuse new paternity with humor. Another popular book, <em>Commando Dad: How to Be an Elite Dad or Carer</em>, imagined fatherhood as a battlefield, an appropriately testosterone-filled terrain. Of course, there were other books that attempted to induct men into this new phase of life less comically. But regardless of the tone, my mother and her generation found the mere existence of these books, and their underlying assumptions, bizarre. In the end, I didn’t purchase books about fatherhood for Diwan. Stocking books about pregnancy was already enough of a gamble. I’d save my time and resources for titles that would sell.</p>
<hr />
<p>“I can work as long as it is daylight,” the female candidates would often respond. I knew the subtext: Respectable girls don’t come home after dark. If they do, their neighbors judge them, and that judgement earns them a reputation that diminishes their odds for a good marriage. Also, being out of the home in the evening meant taking public transportation, where women were subjected to a near-constant barrage of harassment from drivers and fellow passengers. I was familiar with the compromises women made under patriarchy: they competed for their family’s resources, subordinate to their brothers; they were limited in where they could go and who they could see. On top of all that, as my male coworkers liked to remind me, it was more financially advantageous to hire men. This is partly because Egyptian labor laws grant women ninety days of paid maternity leave for their first two children. Men have more working hours, especially since the basic concept of paternity leave is nonexistent in Egypt. It struck me as ironic that the very laws that attempted to guarantee women their rights—like paid maternity leave—also exposed them to discrimination. Even though hiring women could be a pain in the ass, I chose to do it anyway because I am a woman and I pay it forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>“As a woman, how do you reconcile the demands of home and work?”</p>
<p>“I don’t.” I swallowed. “I never will. I wouldn’t trust anyone who claims to have done so. No one asks men how they balance the demands of their families and their children with their professional lives. I’m a guilty working mother. I miss so many baths and diaper changes. My children’s nanny is always there. On some days I get home so exhausted that I don’t want to play with my daughters or read to them as they go to sleep. But I made my choices. I want my girls to grow up in a home where their mother works. I am a single parent, and I am proud and grateful.” The journalist just stared at me, startled.</p>
<p>I’d been truthful with her, but not entirely honest. I didn’t describe the depth of my angst.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-classics" class="section level1">
<h1>The Classics</h1>
<p>In the early 2000s, as existing publishing houses were expanding and new ones were building their lists, they moved beyond reprints and began releasing a greater variety of modern Arabic literature. People took renewed interest in Egyptian writers, many of whom had gained recognition in the eighties and nineties but only recently got their full due: Ibrahim Adbelmeguid, Radwa Ashour, Ibrahim Aslan, Salwa Bakr, Gamal al-Ghitani, Sonallah Ibrahim, Mohamed Mansi Qandil, Edwar al-Kharrat, Adbel-Hakim Qasim, and Bahaa Taher, to name but a few. Not satisfied with what was Egyptian and locally available, Hind had researched and stocked other critically acclaimed Arab authors, like Hoda Barakat (Lebanon), Mohamed Choukri (Morocco), Rabee Jaber (Lebanon), Sahar Khalifeh (Palestine), Addelrahman Munif (Saudi Arabia), and Tayed Salih (Sudan), who made it onto our bestseller lists. Before Diwan, these books were only available to Egyptian readers during the Cairo International Book Fair, when Arab publishers showcased their best-selling authors. Otherwise, they’d been trapped under the rubble of failed distribution channels. Hind found their publishers and imported from all over the Arab world. I was proud of her, and a bit jealous. I told myself that I’d find the English translations of her novels. She didn’t share my competitive streak, caring mostly about introducing worthy readers to worthy writers.</p>
