<h2>03</h2>
<p>I wake hanging two inches above the sea. It roars black and bottomless, its spray icy against my face. For a moment it must be the most perfect dream and then the moment passes and I realize I’m awake and my body lurches with such shock that I nearly fall.</p>
<p>I’m clinging to the rope ladder I saw Ennis use. Swaying precariously against the ship’s hull. My knuckles are white and frozen in their grip, and I am not wearing enough layers, not even close.</p>
<p>I have sleepwalked here.</p>
<p>I am about to haul myself the hell up when instead I stop. I’ve found myself in strange places before, but never this extreme, this perilous. I feel abruptly alive, for the first time in years. For the first time, if I’m being honest, since the night my husband left me.</p>
<p>To be fair, I left him first, more times than I can count.</p>
<p>“Yours is a terrible will,” he told me once. And that is true, but I have been a casualty of it far longer than he has.</p>
<p>The rope’s ascent drags me from the sea. Someone has turned on the crank and now I rise without having decided to do so. For a second I hate whoever is pulling me up. Then thoughts blur as the cold finds its mark. Hands haul me over into a bundle of limbs. The flash of moonlit skin tells me this is Léa, her long frame strong enough to support my useless body. My legs can barely hold me upright, so she does that for me.</p>
<p>“What the <em>fuck</em>.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“You’re goddamn freezing.” She starts pulling me over the deck, catching me when I stumble. “What the fuck are you doing, Franny,” she says, but not really like a question. “What is wrong with you.”</p>
<p>We manage to get down the ladder and below deck. My teeth are tiny jackhammers. Into the little bathroom with its shower so narrow I have to step out to wash my hair. She wrenches off my sweater and shoves me under a stream of hot water. It burns so badly I bite my tongue and taste copper. Knees give out, and she catches me in time to sink with me to the floor, both of us soaked and scalded now, a tangled mess of extremities freezing and burning and everything in between.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with you?” she asks again, but really asking now.</p>
<p>I give a breath of laughter. “How much time do you have?”</p>
<p>Her arms tighten about me, shifting to an embrace.</p>
<p>I don’t have the energy for more, so I say only, “I’m sorry,” and I mean it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level2">
<h2>09</h2>
<p>“Anik said you don’t like me because I don’t have the training to be here. He said it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>Ennis grunts.</p>
<p>“Is that all it is?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I lick my dry, cracked lips. “Okay. We can do this, you and me, we can do this whole thing with you hating me for some reason and that’s all right, I can deal with that. Or we can just talk and maybe make things easier for us both.”</p>
<p>Long moments pass and I guess that means he’s chosen the first option. Truth is I’m not sure why it bothers me. Of all the things that matter, Ennis’s regard is not one. Not in the scheme of things. And yet with each passing day his dislike digs deeper under my skin. Maybe it’s because I’ve been working my ass off on his boat, and I’d kind of hoped he might respect that.</p>
<p>“It’s not just that,” Ennis finally admits.</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
<p>He doesn’t look at me as he says, “I know your kind.”</p>
<p>“My <em>kind</em>?”</p>
<p>“Greenies.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jesus, now you sound like fucking Basil.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what you believe in. That’s your business. But why come on my boat with those eyes and look at us like that?”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like we’re scum. Like I’m scum.”</p>
<p>I pause, astonished. “I don’t think you’re scum.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t reply.</p>
<p>“Ennis, I don’t.”</p>
<p>Again, nothing, and it’s clear he doesn’t believe me. My mind whirls, trying to figure out if he’s right. I haven’t said a word to any of them about what I think, except to Basil last night. But I guess I haven’t needed to. I don’t think they’re scum—against all my better judgment I’m actually starting to like these people—but there’ll always be a part of me that’s disgusted by what they do. Maybe once upon a time the world could tolerate the way we hunted, the way we devoured, but not anymore.</p>

<p>“The fuck happened?” he asks.</p>
<p>“No clue,” I say. “You got hit and your whole body shut down. Your heart stopped, Sam.”</p>
<p>He rolls onto his back once more and stares at the ceiling. We watch him, frightened. I don’t know what kind of injury could cause your whole body to shut down like that, and I imagine jumping back onto his chest and pumping it once more, blowing my breath between his cold lips once more. If he goes again I will have to.</p>
<p>But instead Samuel says, “<em>Like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves…</em>”</p>
<p>And I laugh, startled—because even now—and I say, “<em>As though we were drowning inside our hearts.</em>”</p>
<p>Samuel says, faintly, “You Irish.” And then he closes his eyes and continues to breathe.</p>

<p>But it’s raw, and suddenly it’s Kilfenora, my family in their kitchen as they played for me, it’s my mother’s cottage by the sea, and it’s missing her, it’s my husband and the distance between our bodies and it’s my daughter, the child I never wanted, the child I fought a battle to be rid of, the one I fell deeply, devastatingly in love with, the one I lost. It’s the littlest one, Ferd, her fingers around my neck and her hot breath against my ear, she has cracked me open and now my own littlest one is in my arms once more, a too-still thing, a most precious thing, breathless and without warmth, and no matter how often I try to leave it behind there will never be an end to this ache, this pain, the feel of her unbearable weightlessness in my hands.</p>
<p>I can hardly feel my body as I move for the door. It’s cold outside and I hardly know it, and before I close the door behind me I hear Blue ask, “Did we upset her?” and Anik’s voice replying, “Something darker did that,” and I’m walking for the hills and shore and sea. I take off all my clothes and wade out into the icy water and the pain is immense and also nothing nothing nothing.</p>
<p>I lie in the sea and feel more lost than ever, because I’m not meant to be homesick, I’m not meant to long for the things I have always been so desperate to leave.</p>
<p>It isn’t fair to be the kind of creature who is able to love but unable to stay.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Hi.” I listen to his breathing a long while.</p>
<p>“Where are you?” he asks, and he sounds very tired.</p>
<p>“Trondheim.”</p>
<p>A moment for him to take that in, to readjust. I ask so much of him. I wear him down. “Why Trondheim?”</p>
<p>“Because I was in Oslo but the city lights made it impossible to see the Aurora.”</p>
<p>“But you’ve found it? How is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m watching from the balcony. It’s the most gorgeous thing, Niall … You’d love it.”</p>
<p>“Whose balcony is it?”</p>
<p>“A friend’s.”</p>
<p>“Are you safe?”</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>“Whose balcony is it? Can you text me their name and address?”</p>
<p>“A couple I met at dinner, Ann and Kai, I’ll text in a bit.”</p>
<p>“Do you have enough money?”</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>“When are you coming home?”</p>
<p>“Soon.”</p>
<p>He pauses awhile. I slide down onto the floor with my back to the wall. The brilliant greens and purples dance across the sky. I can feel him through the phone, it is such a potent thing, like I could touch him, feel his breath on my cheek, smell him. I’m dizzy with it, with his nearness and his terrible absence.</p>
<p>“It’s lonely here, darling,” I say, tears spilling onto my face.</p>
<p>“It’s lonely here, darlin’,” Niall says.</p>
<p>“Don’t hang up.”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>And we don’t, not for a long time.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I sleepwalk. And other things, sometimes. I should have said.”</p>
<p>He takes this in. “Right. Okay. Fuck.” He laughs a bit. “I’m kinda relieved.”</p>
<p>“Relieved?”</p>
<p>“I thought you might have been really regretting last night.”</p>
<p>There’s something so wry in his voice that I too find myself with a slightly unhinged laugh on my lips. “I was asleep.”</p>
<p>“Must have been one hell of a nightmare.”</p>
<p>“I can’t even remember now.”</p>
<p>“You said you were choking.”</p>
<p><em>Scratching in my mouth and lungs</em>—I shiver, block the memory as best I can.</p>
<p>“Do you often dream of choking?”</p>
<p>“No,” I lie, moving past him for the kitchen. With the contents of my stomach flushed down a drain I’m starving. His apartment is simple and too modern for my taste, but we talked about finding a new place last night, somewhere that can be ours.</p>
<p>I raid his fridge but all he has are ultra-healthy grains and seeds and right now I need something greasy to sponge up all the alcohol we consumed last night. “Can we go get a fry-up?”</p>
<p>“Is this really not a big deal to you?” he asks. “Should I expect to get strangled every night? What else happens? Do you leave the house? Is it dangerous?”</p>
<p>For the first time since I woke I force myself to look him in the face. <em>There he is again, pinning me to the bed, stronger in every muscle than I am, something shocked and determined in his eyes and is this how I looked when he woke to the same thing?</em> “It won’t happen again,” I say. “I promise. I have medication I can take.” Another lie. There are no meds that work. But I don’t want him to be scared—for me or of me. I don’t want that look in his eyes, for him to feel the way I felt, waking to his hands pressing me small.</p>

<p>As we leave the mouth of the cove Ennis meets my eyes and there is a thing unspoken now, something I know he understands. <em>There may be no end to this we can survive</em>. Not with only the two of us, setting out on a stolen boat this small, leaving behind the tracking software and the little red dots, discarding a trail of destruction in our wake like the delicate film of a snake’s shed skin. We didn’t get goodbyes or parting glances. We didn’t get guarantees any of them will find a safe way home, if home exists for them beyond what has been burned to ash with the slip of a foot, the crack of a skull.</p>
<p>We watch the Saghani for as long as we can. As he navigates south into the most perilous stretch of ocean left on this planet the captain weeps unashamedly.</p>
<p>I am too numb for any more tears. Too animal now.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’re going to fly around the entire world to eat grass.”</p>
<p>“Harriet’s saying they won’t have to fly around the entire world anymore.”</p>
<p>He flashes me a look that implies I’m a traitor for listening to Harriet. We’re quiet awhile, concentrating on our feet on the slippery ground, on our breath making clouds.</p>
<p>I’m sure we’re both thinking of the creature in her cage.</p>
<p>“You think they’ll keep flying, don’t you,” I say.</p>
<p>Niall nods once, slowly.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s in their nature.”</p>
<hr />
<p><em>I’m holding the skull of a baby wren. I found it this morning in one of the nests in our yard, right down the back in those willow trees; I think its parents must have left it there when it died. Discarded. Or maybe they waited with it as long as they could. It’s like an eggshell, only much tinier, much more delicate. It barely fits on the tip of my pinkie finger. I keep thinking about how easy it would be to crush. It reminds me of her. But not of you. You are made of a different thing. Something far more enduring. I never saw that thing you spoke of, the one that was missing from the stuffed birds in my lab. I see it now, or its absence. Your absence has never felt crueler. I’ve never hated you until now. I’ve never loved you more.</em></p>
