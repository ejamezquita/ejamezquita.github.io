<p>“The chance of a person getting attacked by a wolf is almost nonexistent,” Evan assures them. “This is a shy, family-oriented, <em>gentle</em> creature. We should never have been taught to fear them.”</p>
<p>“That is a lie, sir,” says the farmer. “Predators are feared and hunted because they’re predators—they’re dangerous. My ancestors risked their lives to rid this land of those beasts and now you want to dump them back on our doorsteps. Are we expected to keep our children inside?”</p>
<p>Signs wave amid a lifting of angry voices. If Evan ever had control of the room he’s losing it fast.</p>
<p>I stand. “What’s dangerous,” I say, “is the unwarranted spreading of fear.”</p>
<p>The farmer turns to look at me, as do a hundred other faces. Anne’s sigh of exasperation on the stage might be comical at any other time.</p>
<p>“If you truly think wolves are the blood spillers, then you’re blind,” I say. “<em>We</em> do that. <em>We</em> are the people killers, the children killers. <em>We’re</em> the monsters.”</p>
<p>I sit down within the silence. The cold seems to have deepened in the auditorium.</p>
<p>My eyes are drawn to the man by the door. He’s watching me and I realize what he was searching for in the crowd because he seems to have found it in me. A disruption. A threat.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level1">
<h1>4</h1>
<p>My boss at the Denali Wolf Project in Alaska warned me on my first day on the job. <em>Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can predict a wolf. That’s dangerous. She will always surprise you.</em></p>
<p>A deep thrill electrifies me. I love her ferocity. I can feel it in my throat, tickling there. Adrenaline floods me and she can smell it, I know she can.</p>
<p>The deer carcass is delivered, there’s no need for me to stay.</p>
<p>I want to.</p>
<p>I see it now. How I turn to run and she launches for my thigh, tears my femoral, destroys any chance of escape. So I remain facing her and instead she lunges for my throat, for the part of me most vulnerable. The strength in her body lets her fly, the power in her jaws crushes my bones. I am such a simple meal; I have no speed with which to run, no strength to fight her off. My skin is disastrously thin. Does she know this about me? Can she sense it, as the others of her kind don’t seem to? They are fooled by the power in our voices and our weapons, by our ability to cage them. But this one seems to see beyond that, to my fragility. Or perhaps she doesn’t, maybe she doesn’t care that I have a power she doesn’t, so immense is her fury, her fighting instinct.</p>
<p>I keep my eyes on her as I back out of the pen. Still she doesn’t move, doesn’t rush to devour the carcass like the other five wolves in her pack. She continues to watch me.</p>
<p>From behind the chain links I finally see her join her pack. There is still warmth in the carcass, and this fills her mouth, my mouth. Our teeth make easy work of the flesh. I am overwhelmed by the acrid iron of blood. I have been worried that they might not take to the meat because it smells of humans, but clearly hunger has won out. My own hunger has come awake and it disturbs me. I turn away from the feast.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Can’t track wolves, not really.”</p>
<p>“Then how do you find them?”</p>
<p>“You don’t. You leave them be.”</p>
<p>I slumped, disappointed.</p>
<p>He watched me sideways. “All right then, I’ll tell you a secret. But you must use it for good. Do you promise?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“There is no tracking a wolf,” Dad said. “They are cleverer than we are. So instead you track its prey.”</p>
<p>We grinned at each other.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stop thinking about that solitary paw print. “How’d it move with no tracks like that?”</p>
<p>“The infinite mystery of wolves,” Dad replied, and I decided then that I would discover the creature’s secrets.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-3" class="section level1">

<p>Number Six, alpha female of her dwindling pack, has not stopped howling for two weeks, from dusk until dawn. It’s driving everyone in earshot mad. I’ve had daily phone calls from properties and houses spanning kilometers telling me in no uncertain terms to shut her up. As if she is my dog, and I have merely to discipline her better. I try to explain that she’s a wild creature in mourning. But the thought of a beast grieving her mate in such a confronting, almost <em>human</em> way is too much for most folk. None of us can help carrying her voice within us.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-4" class="section level1">

<p>“The pup would come to know you,” I tell Holly, “and you might train him. They’re intelligent and they learn quickly, and they’re very loyal.”</p>
<p>“See!” Holly says.</p>
<p>“But why would you want to?” I ask. They’re all watching me now; I can feel their eyes, because this is the thing, isn’t it? This is the fear they live with now. The children in us long for monsters to take forms we understand. They want to fear the wolves because they don’t want to fear each other. “Wolves don’t understand or socialize with humans the way dogs do, even when raised from birth,” I say. “Domestication is a product of breeding. It takes many generations to breed the wild from a creature. This dog and the wolf outside aren’t even the same species anymore. No matter how much you loved a wolf pup, it would grow into the predator its nature dictates, and keeping something like that chained up or bound to a house is about as cruel as I could imagine.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5" class="section level1">

<p>“See you at Duncan’s for the next one?” she asks brightly.</p>
<p>I pause at the door. “Bonnie, look. He’s not coming off too well right now. Sleeping with married women. Sleeping with multiple women at the same time.”</p>
<p>Bonnie shifts uncomfortably. “I don’t know what to tell you, Inti.”</p>
<p>“Tell me if you think he’s a good man or not.”</p>
<p>“I think he’s human.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s what I suspected.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-6" class="section level1">
<h1>18</h1>
<p>“The difficulty of working with wild animals,” he agrees. “I often ponder how their fear of us is not a natural state for them. They are not born with it, it is a learned habit, taught to them by us. My family had a wildlife park when I was growing up, and in it there was a small pack of three wolves.”</p>
<p>He has never told me this. I know he grew up in the very far north of Norway, way up in the Arctic Circle, and he has spoken to me before of his memories of the ’80s, when wild wolves returned to Norway. Debate immediately turned to the conservation of these wolves versus the desire to cull them and protect Norway’s agricultural industry. It caused a division among the people, and passionate conflict, because wolves, as Niels said, have an unrivaled ability to make humans <em>feel</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s a pause. “You all right, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“And you’d tell me if you weren’t, wouldn’t you.”</p>
<p>“I’d have thought you’d just want me to toughen up.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t say anything for a while. Then, “Darlin’, you’re going to figure this out one day, but we’re most fallible when trying to raise our children.”</p>
<p>This is, I think, the closest I’m going to get to an acknowledgment of poor choices on her part. About as close to an apology as she’ll ever come.</p>
<hr />
<p>But I cannot accept that. That hers is the only way. Aggie will be different. There has to be a way to heal, and if she has not the will for it, then I will be strong enough and sure enough for her. She can have my soul in place of hers, if she needs it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-7" class="section level1">
<h1>19</h1>
<p>I lift a trembling hand to my eyes, fingers pressing my eyelids closed. I am starting to feel nauseous again. “It turned me into something I hadn’t been,” I admit. “Something I’d never imagined I could be. I wanted to kill him. I wanted it so badly. I was feral. Duncan, I—you have no idea how <em>gentle</em> I used to be. I believed there was magic in the space between our bodies, and now I’m just this… hard, angry thing.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Warm saliva has filled my mouth; I am ravenous. Nothing for humans is as simple, as certain.</p>
<p>I blink in the fading light, only now aware that darkness is falling. Soon we won’t be able to see the feasting wolves, nor our way back. I realize I am still holding Duncan’s arm and let it go.</p>
<p>“We need to leave,” I say.</p>
<p>He doesn’t answer, and then he says, “That was…” Slowly he shakes his head. In the twilight I think there are tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I say softly. “I know.”</p>
<p>Something passes between us, a different kind of understanding. There has been desire since the start, but there is something else now. The quiet he makes me feel. The calm.</p>
<p>But too quickly I realize I was so inside the wolf I didn’t feel what the deer did. No tearing at my flesh, no being eaten. Only the taste of blood. I turn away from Duncan.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-8" class="section level1">
<h1>21</h1>
<p>“Well now, you don’t have to rewild on such large scales. You can start small, in your own backyard. I’ve been growing wildflowers for years and oh—all sorts of wee creatures have been coming to visit me.”</p>
<p>“How wonderful,” I breathe. “Could I come and visit you, too, sometime?”</p>
<p>“Of course, love, I would be honored to have you. It’s so much easier than most folk know,” Mrs. Doyle adds. “But now, change is frightening to some,” she concedes after a little while. “And when you open your heart to rewilding a landscape, the truth is, you’re opening your heart to rewilding yourself.”</p>
<hr />
<p>I climb into my sister’s bed. She is awake, and rolls to face me. We gaze at each other in the dark.</p>
<p>“Are you real?” I whisper.</p>
<p>She makes no sound, no movement.</p>
<p>“Or did you die?”</p>
<p>Aggie reaches to trace her own face, her finger probing her cheeks, my cheeks, her forehead, my forehead, her lips, my lips.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t let go of you,” I press, feeling her touch upon me so viscerally and yet isn’t this the trick of my mind? To pretend there is truth where there is none?</p>
<p>“Are you a ghost?” I ask her.</p>
<p>Aggie squeezes my hand so hard it hurts, so hard my bones could be crushed. She must be trying to hurt me. Then she makes a sign. One of the first she ever came up with.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-9" class="section level1">
<h1>22</h1>
<p>Our fingers twine. From somewhere nearby there is the soft snort of a horse edging closer.</p>
<p>“Do you think we have any control,” I ask, “over what we are?”</p>
<p>She doesn’t retrieve her hand to reply, she leaves it in mine.</p>
<p>“I think most of me got left behind in Dad’s forest. And now I’m all the things I hate.”</p>
