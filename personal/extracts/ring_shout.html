<h1>Four</h1>
<p>Butcher Clyde wasn’t hard to find. His name in fresh red paint on yellow right over the shop across the street: Butcher Clyde’s Choice Cuts &amp; Grillery. The leaflet I’m holding announces the store’s grand opening, offering free meats to patrons. Well, white patrons. Because the leaflet makes plain this here is a Klan establishment. It got a drawing of Uncle Sam hugging a man that resembles Butcher Clyde, both holding sausage links, reading: <em>Wholesome Food for the Moral White Family</em>.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there’s four Klans in robes standing outside the store’s glass window, directing the steady line of patrons. Two I know is Ku Kluxes, faces shifting as they pass a canteen back and forth.</p>
<p>I told Nana Jean about the dream with Butcher Clyde and my meeting with the Aunties. After she get through grumbling about haints, she admits he could be the “blood redhead buckrah man” from her premonitions. Seems he arrived in town a week back, opening up this shop next to the American National Bank building. She warned us to keep our distance. But a whole day gone, and I’m losing patience. This Butcher Clyde snuck into my head, outright threatened me. But I ain’t no scared girl no more. I hunt monsters—they <em>don’t</em> hunt me. So now I’m about to do something real brave or stupid.</p>
<p>I wait for a streetcar to pass, then cross Cherry Street, walking straight to Butcher Clyde’s. White folk in line frown when I skip past them. Probably thinking I’m plumb out of my mind when I march up to the Klans. One, a little bit of a man, looks at me like he gone dumb. I wait for him to recover.</p>
<p>“You lost, girl?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” I respond. “Here to see Butcher Clyde. He know me.”</p>
<p>White folk get thrown off if you act like they don’t expect—least till they remember they gotta put you in your place. I play my other card, looking to a Ku Klux.</p>
<p>“I can see you.” I tap under one eye. “Ugly as sin under that skin.”</p>
<p>The green eyes of the man the Ku Klux wearing don’t blink. He stops drinking from the canteen, letting water run down his chin, and turns to the other Ku Klux, like they got a silent way of speaking. My gamble pays off.</p>
<p>“Let her through,” the Ku Klux says.</p>
<p>The two human Klans set to holler, but I slip right in the door as someone leaves.</p>
<p><em>Bruh Rabbit walking into Bruh Gator’s open jaws</em>, my brother’s voice whispers.</p>
<p>The inside look like any other butcher shop. Smells like one too—fresh blood and raw, open flesh. But there’s also the scent of seared meat coming from a kitchen. And at tables, people sit eating. There’s Klan posters everywhere, one advertising <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> at Stone Mountain Sunday. Men at the counter, every last one a Ku Klux, hand out brown packages to customers. And behind them is none other than Butcher Clyde.</p>
<p>He looks the same from the dream—a hefty bulk of a man. Like the other night he stands with his back to me, singing some awful tune and swinging his cleaver. I start up whistling, loud as I can, and he stops what he doing to turn slow. There’s slight surprise when our eyes meet, but I don’t stay for him to say nothing, walking to take a chair by the front window, leaning back all casual-like. A white lady and her son sitting nearby watch me open-mouthed. I stare back until she turns away. There’s angry buzzing behind me, but Butcher Clyde cuts in.</p>
<p>“Brothers and sisters, don’t let this disturb our feast. The lesser of God’s creatures at times need to be guided righteously to recall their proper place. Rest assured, I will take this one in firm hand. Go on and eat now, eat! Fill up your bellies with the Lord’s sustenance. Make the Invisible Empire strong!”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“You a Ku Klux?”</p>
<p>He laughs. “Us? One of them? Like comparing you to a dog, which we understand they’ve developed a taste for. Not to worry, don’t serve that here.”</p>
<p>“A dog. So you they master, then?”</p>
<p>“<em>Master</em> might be a bit much. Think of us more like”—he twirls thick fingers, grabbing for a word—“management.”</p>
<p>“Why you here?”</p>
<p>“Why, to fulfill the grand plan, of course.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>“Bringing the glory of our kind to your world. Putting an ed to your strife and bickering. Relieving you of the abomination of your meaningless existence. We strive to give you purpose, which you will come to know once you have been properly joined to our harmonious union.”</p>
<p>“Harmonious union?” I gesture at the Klan posters and whatnot. “That what you call this ode to the great white race?”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind that. We need you to let us in, to merge you to our great collective.” His gaze wanders over the shop’s patrons. “They was just the most willing. So easy to devour from the inside, body and soul. Always have been.”</p>
<p>As spike of anger hits me. “That why you have them go around killing us?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we might point them in a direction we need, but that hate they got in them is their own doing. You see, Maryse, we don’t care about what skin you got or religion. Far as we concerned, you all just meat.”</p>
<p>He rolls his neck, and as I watch sores break out across his skin—on his face, his forearms, his fingers. Not sores. Little mouths, like in the dream. Even his eyes roll back, leaving red gums and jagged teeth behind his spectacles. Every tongue flicks the air hungrily and right then, I see him. <em>Really</em> see him. Now I understand why he keeps saying <em>we</em> and <em>us</em>. This ain’t one thing—it’s dozens! I can see the places where they join together, stitched up in this human suit. They move about under his skin, like maggots in a corpse. A shiver shakes me and I grip my sword, imagining jumping up to slice that thick neck off his shoulders—and a hundred slithering things spilling out.</p>
<p>When he talks again, all those mouths talk too—dozens of shrill voices mashing together that only I can hear. “You haven’t asked us the biggest question. Ask it. Ask it!”</p>
<p>I clench my teeth at the jarring chorus, but I ask, “What’s coming?”</p>
<p>Those horrible mouths turn up into wicked grins.</p>
<p>“Grand Cyclops is coming,” they croon. “When she do, your world is over.”</p>
<p>I look at him, not understanding.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to keep up this fight, Maryse. Told you we’ve been watching you. There’s a special place for you in our grand plan.”</p>
<p>“Fuck your grand plan,” I spit back.</p>
<p>He laughs, and something deep in his belly growls.</p>

<div id="six" class="section level1">
<h1>Six</h1>
<p>Nana Jean’s face frowns deep as I recount my meeting with the Aunties. She stay quiet, just sits in her chair staring at nothing. It’s Chef who speaks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Doctors, Night Doctors Sneak in under your door. Thief a n****r tongue and eyes Then come back for more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Doctors, Night Doctors Take you live or dead, Snip off a n****r’s hands and feet, And even take his head.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Doctors, Night Doctors Snatch you to they white hall. Cut a poor n****r child wide open, Show him his liver and his gall.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Night Doctors, Night Doctors You can cry and carry on. But when they done dissectin’ Every bit of you is gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she finishes, the farmhouse is still. Outside the wind whistles through the bottle trees, the trapped haints either laughing wicked or wailing with fright. The Shouters take to staring at me like I’m John the Conqueror run off with the devil’s daughter.</p>
<p>“Who are these Night Doctors?” Emma asks, looking around for answers.</p>
<p>Across the table Chef leans back, a joker between her fingers. “Stories. Heard it from a fella in my unit, whose people was from Virginia. Told us about his great grandpappy’s talk from slavery times. Night Doctors was supposed to be haints—tall and dressed in white—who stole away slaves and experimented on them. But none of its real. Was just old masters going around at night scaring slaves. Hear it came about, on account they sold the bodies of dead slaves to medical schools to cut up.”</p>
<p>Emma gasps. “That’s ghastly!”</p>
<p>Chef shrugs. “All of it was. But like I say, just old stories. No such thing as Night Doctors. They not real. Her eyes turn to me, then Nana Jean.”They not real, right?”</p>
<p>The Gullah woman twists up her lips. “Night Doctors, dem ain a story. Disya tale true.” Her brown-gold gaze bores into me. “Hunnuh fuh go ta de bil place t’night?”</p>

<div id="eight" class="section level1">
<h1>Eight</h1>
<p>“So this it, then? You call me here to see your little revival?”</p>
<p>Butcher Clyde’s smile stretches into a jack-o’-lantern’s grin. And I remember he just some things playing at being a person. “We’ve invited you to witness the grand plan.”</p>
<p>“What I tell you the last time about your grand plan.”</p>
<p>He chuckles. “I believe your precise words were, ‘Fuck your grand plan.’ But we haven’t told you the role you’re to play in it. Wouldn’t you like to know? We’ve been planning your part so long.”</p>
<p>When I don’t answer he goes on.</p>
<p>“As you know, we specialize in that thing you call <em>hate</em>. To your kind, it’s just a feeling. A bit of rage behind the eyes that can drive you to commit all sorts of beautiful violence. But for us, those feelings are a power of their own. We feed on it. Treasure it as life.” He turns to the gathered Klans. “Look at all that delightful hate. We didn’t put it there, was always growing inside. Just gave it a nudge to help it blossom. A few reels of celluloid and they come us whole and willing. But sustaining as that hate is, it’s not very… potent.”</p>
<p>I raise an eyebrow. Seems these Klans can hate well enough.</p>
<p>You see, the hate they give is senseless. They already got power. Yet they hate those over who they got control, who don’t really pose a threat to them. Their fears aren’t real—just insecurities and inadequacies. Deep down they know that. Makes their hate like… watered-down whiskey. Now your people!”</p>
<p>His eyes light up, and steps closer.</p>
<p>“Y’all got a good reason to hate. All the wrongs been done to you and yours? A people who been whipped and beaten, hunted and hounded, suffered so grievously at their hands. You have every reason to despise them. To loathe them for centuries of depravations. That hate would be so pure, so sure and righteous—so strong!”</p>
<p>His body shudders, like he imagining the sweetest wine.</p>
<p>“What I got to do with any of that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Maryse, you’re our top candidate!”</p>
<p>The confusion on my face stretches his grin impossibly wider.</p>
<p>“Told you we’ve been watching you. We knew those interlopers were going to crown a champion to wield their little magic against us, as they done before. But what if we could guide that choice? Instead of fighting their champion, we could help mold her. Let her see what it’s like to hurt. Let that wound fester. So that she keeps that little seed of hate deep inside. Then we feed it. Water it with our dogs. Let her hunt them, kill them, and enjoy it. And you do enjoy it, don’t you? Why, that hat will keep growing until it’s good and strong, waiting to be harvested, waiting for you to just <em>tap</em> into it.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“No, Maryse, you misunderstood our meaning,” Butcher Clyde goes on. “You see, we’re not asking you to switch sides. We’re offering to come over to you.”</p>
<p>I blink, his words chasing everything out of my head. “What?”</p>
<p>He stares intently with those gray eyes. “Be our champion, Maryse. Lead our armies. Give your people the one thing they lack—”</p>
<p>“Hate?” I cut in.</p>
<p>“Power,” he corrects, voice now intense. “What I told you all along. You bring us their righteous justified hate, and we will grant you power—enough to never need fear anyone again. Power enough to protect yourselves and defeat your foes, to make them cower and tremble before you in true fear. Power to avenge all those wrongs. Power over life and death, yours and your enemies!”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><em>They like the places where we hurt. They use it against us.</em></p>
